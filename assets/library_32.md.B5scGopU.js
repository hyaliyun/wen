Given the question: Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm? Options: - sanctuary farm - cow pasture - countryside - cattle ranch - slaughterhouse Explain why a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","candidates_completions":"A human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" to answer the question above because this is the place where cattle, including heifers, are sent for slaughter to produce meat. Once a heifer is no longer useful to the farm, perhaps due to old age or inability to reproduce or produce milk, farmers may choose to sell the heifer to a slaughterhouse. This is a common practice in the agriculture industry, and it allows the farmer to recover some of the costs associated with raising the animal. It's important to note that this is a sensitive topic for many people, as it involves the killing of animals, but it's a reality of the food production process.,Slaughterhouse A human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical option among the given choices, considering the context provided. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm, it implies that she can no longer provide services or financial benefits in terms of milk production, breeding, or labor. Thus, the farmer would seek alternative means to make money from the heifer. Here's a brief analysis of the options to better understand why \\"slaughterhouse\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Sanctuary farm: Sanctuary farms primarily serve as safe havens for animals, where they are not exploited for profit. They rescue and provide a home for injured or abused animals. In this case, the farmer is looking to make money from the heifer, which wouldn't happen at a sanctuary farm. 2. Cow pasture: A cow pasture is just a grazing area for cows to feed on grass or hay. While the heifer could still graze in a pasture, this would not generate any income for the farmer when she's deemed \\"no longer useful\\" to the farm operation-wise. 3. Countryside: The countryside refers to the rural areas outside urban settings. Simply sending the heifer to the countryside would not guarantee any financial gain for the farmer, as it would probably live freely, without any sale or productive purpose. 4. Cattle ranch: A cattle ranch primarily focuses on breeding and raising cattle for various agricultural purposes. In the given context, the farmer has already deemed the heifer no longer useful; hence, it would not contribute significantly to the cattle ranch operations or the farmer's financial objectives. 5. Slaughterhouse: A slaughterhouse is a facility where animals are processed and turned into meat products. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm in other aspects, the farmer could sell the heifer to a slaughterhouse to make money from the sale of meat and other byproducts, such as leather and bones. This option directly fulfills the farmer's intention of generating income from the heifer in an alternative way. Therefore, given these explanations, a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question because it aligns with the objective of making money from the heifer when she no longer serves her original purpose on the farm.,Slaughterhouse. A human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the answer to the question above because, when a heifer (a young female cattle) is no longer useful to the farm, farmers need to consider its value as a source of income. Generally, in the agricultural industry, when farm animals are no longer producing or contributing to the farm's operations, they are sold or sent to a slaughterhouse. The meat from the heifer's carcass would then be processed and distributed in the food industry. This option provides the most monetary value for the farmer, as the other options – sanctuary farm, cow pasture, countryside, and cattle ranch – do not offer a direct means of generating revenue from an animal that can no longer perform farm tasks."},{"prompt":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I always enjoyed this movie and I wanted it in my movie library.....the end of the movie is the best part.....it never disappoints.

Born on December 12, 1925, and passed away on July 24, 2000, Shamloo's poetry played a prominent role in the development of modern Iranian literature. His noteworthy literary achievements would be recognized and admired in Finland, just as they are around the globe. In Finnish discussions, his name would still be referred to as \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" to maintain the accurate representation of his identity and contributions to literature and culture.,In Finnish, \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" is said the same as in the original language it was used. The reason for this is that names generally do not need to be translated when they are proper nouns, they are used in their original form in different languages worldwide. Ahmad Shamloo is the name of a renowned Iranian Poet and Literary critic. Ahmad Shamloo is typically pronounced as \\"Ah-mad Sha-loo\\" in English. However, the pronunciation may differ slightly across different cultures and languages, it's always encouraged to use the correct pronunciation based on the native language. But if you need to rewrite the name to make it sound Finnish, the alteration would be insignificant. Finnish alphabet, though vastly similar to the Latin one, has only minor differences. The name could be written in Finnish as \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" or \\"Ahamadi Shamloo\\" to reflect the Finnish-equivalent characters. Again, the Finnish language does not have different pronunciation rules for names spoken in other languages – all names are pronounced as in their original words. Thus, there would likely be no changes in the way you'd say \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" in Finnish., In Finnish, the name \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" can be translated as \\"Ahmad Shamlu\\". However, it is important to note that translating names from one language to another is not always a straightforward process. This is because names are often deeply tied to the culture and history of a particular language, and may not have a direct equivalent in another language. In this case, \\"Ahmad\\" and \\"Shamloo\\" are both Persian names, and their pronunciation and spelling in Finnish is an attempt to approximate the original Persian sounds and letters using the closest corresponding Finnish sounds and letters. The name \\"Ahmad\\" is composed of two parts: \\"Ah\\" and \\"mad\\". The first part, \\"Ah\\", is a common prefix in Arabic and Persian male names, and it is often translated as \\"more\\" or \\"better\\" in English. The second part, \\"mad\\", is derived from the Arabic word \\"mahd\\", which means \\"praiseworthy\\" or \\"commendable\\". The name \\"Shamloo\\" is a Persian surname that is derived from the Arabic word \\"shaml\\", which means \\"candle\\" or \\"lamp\\". It is likely that the name was given to a family that made or sold candles or lamps, or that was known for their knowledge of lighting. In Finnish, the name \\"Ahmad Shamlu\\" would be pronounced as \\"Ah-mad Sham-lu\\", with the emphasis on the first syllable of each name. The letter \\"a\\" in \\"Ahmad\\" is pronounced as a short \\"a\\" sound, as in the English word \\"cat\\". The letter \\"h\\" is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, similar to the \\"ch\\" sound in Scottish English. The letter \\"d\\" is pronounced as a voiced alveolar plosive, similar to the \\"d\\" sound in English. The letter \\"m\\" is pronounced as a bilabial nasal, similar to the \\"m\\" sound in English. The letter \\"s\\" in \\"Shamlu\\" is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar fricative, similar to the \\"s\\" sound in English. The letter \\"h\\" is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, similar to the \\"h\\" sound in English. The letter \\"a\\" is pronounced as a short \\"a\\" sound, as in the English word \\"cat\\". The letter \\"m\\" is pronounced as a bilabial nasal, similar to the \\"m\\" sound in English. The letter \\"l\\" is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant, similar to the \\"l\\" sound in English. The letter \\"u\\" is pronounced as a close back rounded vowel, similar to the \\"oo\\" sound in English. In summary, the name \\"Ahmad Shamloo\\" can be said in Finnish as \\"Ah-mad Sham-lu\\", with the emphasis on the first syllable of each name. The Finnish pronunciation is an approximation of the original Persian sounds and letters, and it may not be exactly the same as the original Persian pronunciation. However, it is a respectful and accurate way to say the name in Finnish, and it shows an understanding of the history and culture behind the name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: i. no; ii. yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","candidates_completions":"Sure, let me help you understand these questions like I would for a five-year-old. Question 1: What are the best gifts for dad? So, the best thing to give dad depends on what he likes or needs. It could be a new tool, a sporty watch, a shirt, or even a book he wants to read. Gifts like these can make him happy because they show we love and care for him. Question 2: What is the best gift which can be given to dad? Again, the best gift depends on what dad likes or needs. If we choose something that is special to him or helps him enjoy himself, it will make him very happy too. Now, for your third question: Would the answer to these two questions be the same? Well, sometimes the answers to them can be similar because both questions are asking about the best gift we can give dad. But the answers could still be a bit different. In the first question, we are trying to figure out some good ideas, while in the second question, we're looking for the 'best' one. It's like asking for the top choices versus asking for one perfect choice. So, the answers could be the same if both questions were about giving dad his favorite thing. But usually, the answers will be a bit different because we're looking for different things (good gifts versus the 'best' gift)., The answer to these two questions may not necessarily be the same, because the first question asks for \\"gifts\\" (plural) which implies you're looking for multiple options, while the second question asks for \\"the best gift\\", which implies you're looking for just one recommendation.

Question 2: What is the best gift which can be given to dad? The best gift for dad would depend on his interests and tastes. However, one universally great gift that is sure to make him feel special is a handmade card or artwork from you. The time and effort you put into creating something just for him will make it truly the best gift.

The question we can answer is: \\"Would the answer to these two questions be the same?\\" In other words, will the answers to both questions suggest the same gift ideas?

The most powerful woman in the world, according to US Forbes magazine, was in China last week. She came to discuss trade and environmental issues with China's top leaders. Germany's first woman leader is known as a brave and practical statesman . Even since her time at school, she had the habit of getting everything in order. Every day before doing her homework she would clean the desk and think about what to do next. \\"I prefer a long time for full preparations to make my decision. But once I decide, I will stand up for what I believe,\\" Merkel said. Perhaps it was good habits that helped her do well in her studies. At 32, she got a doctorate in physics and then she worked as a researcher. However, the life of a scholar couldn't put off her love of politics. While working in labs, Merkel took time off to read political books and at last joined a political party. \\"Her calmness helped her stand out in the party.

But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says. But now, he sets his own schedule. At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year.

She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"What was the result of following terrorist money flowing from point A to point B?\\" Answer: \\"CIA found it was hard to attack funds of Al Qaeda\\" Is this answer correct? Choose from: a. no b. yes...I think the answer is","candidates_completions":"a. no, I would say no, the answer is not completely correct. While it's true that following terrorist money from point A to point B didn't reveal much about the terrorists' plans and intentions, according to the chief of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, it doesn't mean that they found it hard to attack the funds of Al Qaeda. In fact, the text mentions that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) was able to freeze some Al Qaeda and Taliban assets that reached the U.S. financial system, and that after October 1999, it became the duty of U.S. banks to block Al Qaeda's transactions and seize its funds.

I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gaining higher amounts of money for the school.

The first sentence: \\"It is used for the training of Bayero University medical students and postgraduate medical doctors (Residency training).\\" The second sentence: \\"It is used for the training of medical students and doctors at Bayero University (Residency Training).\\" The main difference between the two sentences lies in the specificity of the groups being referred to. In the first sentence, \\"Bayero University medical students and postgraduate medical doctors\\" is mentioned, indicating a more precise description of the trainee population. In contrast, the second sentence uses the more general terms \\"medical students and doctors,\\" which could potentially include a broader range of trainees. Additionally, the first sentence specifically mentions \\"Residency training\\" in parentheses, highlighting the postgraduate nature of the training for medical doctors. Though the second sentence also refers to \\"Residency Training\\" at the end, it does not explicitly connect this training with the doctors' postgraduate status. While both sentences share a similar meaning, the first one is more specific about the trainee groups and emphasizes the postgraduate nature of the training.,To determine if these two sentences convey the same meaning, I will analyze them step-by-step. 1. Compare the subjects: Both sentences mention \\"It\\", which refers to an entity or facility, and both sentences talk about the training of medical students and doctors at Bayero University. So, the main subjects are the same. 2. Compare the purposes: In both sentences, the purpose of this facility or entity is to provide training to medical students and doctors. They also mention \\"Residency training\\" in parentheses, which is a type of postgraduate medical training. Thus, the purpose of the facility or entity is the same in both sentences. 3. Compare the structure and order of information: The first sentence explicitly states \\"Bayero University medical students and postgraduate medical doctors (Residency training)\\" while the second one says \\"medical students and doctors at Bayero University (Residency Training)\\". Although the structure is slightly different, the same information is conveyed. Conclusion: Yes, both sentences essentially mean the same thing, as they talk about the same subjects, purposes, and provide the same information. The slight difference in the structure of the sentences does not change their overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The child talked to Erin but not to Tanya, because Available choices: 1). Erin didn't speak English very well.; 2). Tanya didn't speak English very well.;","candidates_completions":"The child talked to Erin but not to Tanya, because Tanya didn't speak English very well. This can be explained in more detail considering various factors that might influence a child's decision on who to interact with. Firstly, we must consider the child's age and cognitive development. At this stage, children learn and absorb new information rapidly, which means they're likely to be drawn towards someone who can hold engaging conversations and support their expanding knowledge. In this case, Erin may be a more fluent and expressive communicator in English, making it easier for the child to understand and engage in the conversation. Moreover, the child might be more familiar with Erin or may share common interests, making them less reserved when interacting with Erin compared to Tanya. Secondly, we should consider the context in which the conversation took place. For instance, if the conversation occurred in a classroom or a place where English was the primary language, it would be more natural for the child to choose to speak to someone who could understand and express themselves in English. On the other hand, if there were more individuals present who could communicate in the same language as Tanya, such as her native tongue, then she might have had more conversation partners. Thirdly, Tanya's linguistic abilities in English might have been the most significant factor driving the child's decision. As mentioned earlier, it's more natural for the child to choose a conversation partner who can understand and communicate with them effectively and fluently. Given that Tanya didn't speak English very well, she might not be able to express herself properly or might struggle to understand the child's questions or statements. This lack of communication might make the child feel discouraged or uncertain, eventually prompting them to engage with someone else who can comprehend them better, such as Erin. Lastly, it's essential to consider the child's personal disposition and preferences when it comes to communication styles and relationships. For example, the child might prefer more animated conversations, laughter, and friendliness, which could be more evident in conversations with Erin. Conversely, if Tanya preferred more formal and calm communication methods, the child might not find her as engaging or approachable. In conclusion, the child's decision to engage in conversation with Erin and not with Tanya, even though both were present, could be due to Tanya's limited English language skills. Various factors such as context, individual preferences, and personal disposition might also contribute to this decision. Regardless of the reasons behind it, it is crucial for parents and educators to encourage children to practice their language skills with different individuals and continue to support their learning in a compassionate and inclusive environment., The child talked to Erin but not to Tanya because the first option is true, Erin didn't speak English very well. The child may have been more comfortable speaking in English and therefore chose to communicate with Erin, who they believed would understand them better. Alternatively, it's possible that Tanya is able to speak English fluently, but the child was unaware of this fact and assumed that Tanya would have communication difficulties. Regardless of the reason, the child's decision to speak to Erin but not Tanya highlights the importance of clear communication and the impact it can have on our interactions with others. When we are able to communicate effectively, we are more likely to build strong relationships, understand each other's needs and perspectives, and work together to achieve common goals. On the other hand, when communication breaks down, it can lead to misunderstandings, frustration, and even conflict. In this particular situation, the child may have missed out on an opportunity to get to know Tanya better or to learn something new from her. It's possible that Tanya had valuable insights or experiences to share, but the child was unable to tap into this potential resource due to the language barrier. This serves as a reminder of the importance of being open-minded and willing to engage with others, even when communication is challenging. In order to overcome language barriers and build stronger relationships, there are a few strategies that can be helpful. First, it's important to be patient and take the time to listen carefully to what the other person is saying. This can help to reduce misunderstandings and build trust. Additionally, using simple language and avoiding jargon or complex phrases can make communication easier for both parties. Another effective strategy is to use visual aids, such as pictures, diagrams, or gestures, to help illustrate concepts and ideas. This can be especially helpful when working with children, who may be more visual learners. Finally, it can be helpful to seek out resources, such as language translation apps or bilingual dictionaries, to support communication and build understanding. In conclusion, the child talked to Erin but not to Tanya because Erin didn't speak English very well. However, this situation highlights the importance of clear communication and the value of being open-minded and willing to engage with others, even when language barriers exist. By using effective communication strategies, such as patience, simple language, visual aids, and seeking out resources, we can build stronger relationships and overcome communication challenges.,The child talked to Erin but not to Tanya, because Tanya didn't speak English very well. Erin, on the other hand, was fluent in English even though it wasn't her native language. Over time, Erin had invested significant time and effort to learn English, attending classes, and practicing with native speakers in order to become proficient. The child, being a native English speaker, found it easier and more comfortable to converse with Erin as they were able to communicate effortlessly and understand each other perfectly. On the contrary, Tanya, despite her warm and friendly nature, faced linguistic challenges that made it difficult for her to communicate with the child. She had only started learning English a few months ago and hadn't yet achieved a level of fluency to engage in a meaningful conversation. The language barrier between Tanya and the child made it almost impossible for them to connect and share their thoughts, feelings, and ideas with each other. The child, being relatively young, hadn't yet developed the necessary patience and understanding to facilitate communication with someone who didn't speak their language proficiently. As kids often prefer engaging with others who can easily understand them and respond, the child felt more at ease while talking to Erin. This natural tendency played a significant role in their decision to engage more with Erin than with Tanya. It was quite apparent that Tanya wanted to engage with the child as well; she often tried to learn new words and phrases in order to be a part of their conversations. However, her limited vocabulary, coupled with her struggle to comprehend and construct sentences with appropriate grammar, prevented her from participating in deeper conversations. As a result, the child felt inclined to stick to communicating with Erin, who could easily grasp and participate in discussions without needing any additional assistance. This situation, however, also provided an invaluable learning opportunity for Tanya. Her interaction with the child motivated her to enroll in more advanced English courses and actively seek out conversation partners to improve her language skills. Over time, she became more fluent in English and eventually managed to bridge the communication gap that once existed between her and the child. In conclusion, the child talked to Erin but not to Tanya because Tanya didn't speak English very well, making communication difficult. This language barrier deterred the child from engaging with Tanya, while Erin's fluency in English contributed to a smoother and more natural interaction. While the situation might seem unfavorable at first, it eventually became a means for Tanya to further her language-learning journey and effectively enhance her communication skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report or Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly. An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. But although Volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do Renaissance, Volckman's end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that. Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. As such, Renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. The screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the English translation - the film's title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. Though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work. Volckman's film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. With tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a Frank Miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. The film's English rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. The gruff voice of Daniel Craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman Karas, and Catherine McCormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating. Despite a wavering English accent, Romola Garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and Jonathan Pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation Avalon. Ian Holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes. All together, Renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. Though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. For fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of Frank Miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch. -8/10 What is the sentiment of this review? pick from the following.

She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King and I opened August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of Bitter Sweet in 1959 was her last professional appearance. MacDonald and her husband, Gene Raymond, toured in Ferenc Molnar's The Guardsman. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater, Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 northeastern and midwestern cities until June 2, 1951. Despite less than enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of \\"The Actress\\" was changed to \\"The Singer\\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show still closed before reaching Broadway. In the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of Sunset Boulevard. Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project. Composer Hugh Martin also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \\"Wasn't It Romantic?\\". MacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in the smoky atmosphere.","candidates_completions":"This text is about Jeanette Anna MacDonald, an American singer and actress who was best remembered for her musical films in the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier and Nelson Eddy.

Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there.

Article:For Cave and everyone else competing in the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona on 8 October, Hawaii will mean blistering heat, barren fields of black lava and desiccating crosswinds. There's also the small matter of swimming (2.4 miles), cycling (112 miles) and running (26.2 miles) a total of 140.6 miles. Most people will need a holiday after just reading about it. But Leanda Cave is not like most people. More than 14 years after claiming a triathlon silver medal for Wales at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Cave is preparing to put herself through the one of the toughest challenges facing endurance athletes. And the 38-year-old, who won the event in 2012, has no problem explaining why. \\"It's the glory of winning,\\" she said. Listen again: Leanda Cave on BBC Radio Wales \\"There's nothing like it and I've experienced it - I guess it's almost like a drug, it's an addiction, you want it, you crave it. \\"When you're on the start line you're all going for the same thing, to win a race and it's only one person who can win the race and it's nice to be in the mix and give it a shot.\\" Cave has won world titles at Olympic distance, long distance, half-Ironman and Ironman triathlons. Yet the feeling that she still has something to prove after crashing out of last year's race is part of the incentive for Cave as she goes into the last stages of a month-long preparation in Hawaii. \\"It's funny because I ask myself this same question why I come back every year - and here I am doing it again,\\" Cave explained. \\"Last year I crashed my bike and I thought that would be the end of me. \\"It took a huge emotional toll but then I guess it's that fighting spirit that you want to get to the finishing line and you want to succeed and you don't want things to stop you. \\"So after I got over the emotional stress of crashing last year I felt like I couldn't not come back. \\"I have to get to the finish line and sure it's a year later but it's me wanting to redeem myself for some misfortune in the past.\\" In a sport of extremes, the race in Hawaii takes even Ironman triathlon to the limit of physical endurance and mental stress. In addition to the heat - which can top 90 degrees Fahrenheit - and the distance, there is the wind. It's a blast so notorious it has a name - \\"Ho'omumuku\\". It's a physical force competitors have to battle during the cycle phase in particular, and a dehydrating factor for athletes whose metabolisms are operating at the limits of capability. Cave has won races in Arizona and Florida in a career that has taken her around the world but has the utmost respect for the harsh challenge Hawaii presents for athletes. \\"I always get out here about the month before the race,\\" she said. \\"It's definitely some of the toughest conditions I've experienced in this sport. \\"It's hot and very windy and the terrain is black. It's volcanic and it's just very tough and I like to make sure I'm ready for it not in the physical sense but in the mental sense. \\"This is my 10th year here in Kona and I have had success here in the past. \\"But I've also failed miserably many times and it's just good to come back and feel confident that I know the course and I know the weather and nothing comes as a surprise on race day. \\"I suppose the unique thing about Hawaii is because it's such a tough race it's sometimes not so much the fittest person on the day who wins. \\"It's having everything go right for the one particular athlete on the day - on days when all your cards are right, you get dealt the good hand and somehow magic happens. \\"I feel really good. But this year has not gone as well - I haven't had a very solid season and I wouldn't say that's lack of results or performances, it's just I haven't raced a lot and I've normally raced 10 times a year before I get to Kona. And this year I've dialled it back a bit because I've had several other commitments on the table. \\"But in saying that it's given me a little bit longer to prepare for this event. \\"I'm feeling pretty good but this race I feel at times it's still a bit of a mystery. \\"I'm nervous and I think that's a good thing to come here and not expect to do well, I've got to race smart and put in the best performance I can do.\\" A summary of the above article is?","candidates_completions":"The article talks about Leanda Cave, a professional triathlete, and her preparation for the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii on 8 October.

Cut the stems off the flowers. 2. Open a book and lay the flowers between two sheets of tissue paper. This is so the book pages don't stick to the petals. 3. Close the book gently to flatten the flowers. 4. Repeat with more flowers until you have enough to fill one page. 5. Stack books on top of each other with the flowers inside. Now, the books will hold the flowers tightly and press them flat. Over time, the flowers will dry, and you'll have pressed flowers. And don't forget - always ask an adult for help when using scissors or pressing flowers!, Sure, I'd be happy to explain that to you! When you want to press flowers using the book press method, you need to follow these steps: 1. First, cut the stems off of the flowers. This will help the flowers lay flat and prevent any moisture from seeping into the pages of the book. 2. Next, take a book (or a magazine) and open it up to the middle. 3. Lay a piece of tissue paper down on one of the pages. 4. Then, gently place the flower on top of the tissue paper. Make sure the flower is lying flat and is not wrinkled or bent. 5. Once the flower is in place, cover it with another piece of tissue paper. 6. Now, close the book (or magazine) gently, making sure not to crush the flower. 7. If you're using a book, repeat this process with another flower on the opposite page of the book. This will help the flowers press evenly. 8. Once you have placed all of your flowers in the book, stack a few more books (or magazines) on top. This will help apply even pressure to the flowers. 9. Finally, leave the book in a dry, warm place for a few days or even weeks. This will allow the flowers to dry out and become pressed.

To press flowers using the book press method, you should follow these steps: 1. First, you need to cut the stems off the flowers to make them flat. 2. Next, you need to open a book. Books are those things with lots of pages with words inside, like your storybooks. 3. Now, you need 2 sheets of tissue paper. Tissue paper is a thin and soft paper, like what you use to wipe your nose when you have a cold. 4. Place one sheet of tissue paper on a page in the book. Then, lay the flowers on the tissue paper so they don't touch each other. 5. Put the second sheet of tissue paper on top of the flowers. This is like giving the flowers a comfy blanket! 6. Close the book gently and make sure the flowers don't move around. 7. If you have more flowers, you can repeat steps 2-6 and put them into another book. 8. Now stack the books on top of each other. This is like giving the flowers a big hug that helps them dry and keep their pretty colors.

At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. Context: The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18, 2002, along with Florida's second-round pick in the 2002 draft (Lee Falardeau) for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, as well as the Rangers' first and second-round choices in the 2002 draft (Petr Taticek and Rob Globke, respectively) and a fourth-round choice in the 2003 draft. The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he requested a trade from the Canucks in 1997. After losing their initial bid for Bure, Wayne Gretzky, who retired the same season Bure was dealt to Florida, announced prior to the 1999-2000 season he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull off the trade. Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19, scoring a goal against his former team. He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games after being traded, bettering his pace with Florida that season. Between the two teams, he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points. Bure suffered another knee injury in the 2002-03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist in his first game back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points. Even after two operations, Bure did not play in 2003-04 due to the lingering effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play.

Q:Process: - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more coal mining happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","candidates_completions":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you've proposed, which suggests an increase in coal mining, would indeed have an effect (direct) on the process that leads to acid rain. Here's how: - Increased coal mining would mean more coal is available for burning. - More coal burning would lead to an increase in the amount of sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere. - With more sulfur oxides, there would be a higher probability of sulfur trioxide formation, as sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide. - The increased sulfur trioxide would then react with more water in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of more sulfuric acid. - Finally, the increased sulfuric acid in the atmosphere would result in more acidic rain. So, in summary, if more coal mining occurs, it would directly contribute to more acid rain due to the increased production of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.,Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process. If more coal mining occurs, it is likely that more coal will be burned, leading to an increase in sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere. This will result in more sulfur trioxide formation and subsequently, more sulfuric acid production. Ultimately, this will contribute to an increase in acidic rain. Thus, the perturbation of increased coal mining has a direct effect on the process, resulting in more acid rain.,The supposed perturbation, i.e., an increase in coal mining, does have an indirect effect on the process of acid rain formation. As more coal is mined, there is an increased likelihood of it being burned, either for electricity generation or industrial purposes. This leads to higher emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx), which upon reacting with atmospheric oxygen can lead to more sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (SO3). The increased sulfur emissions can result in higher levels of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) production when sulfur oxides react with water. This can subsequently lead to more acidic rain. Hence, the perturbation of increased coal mining can indirectly influence the formation of acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tekstiilituotteiden merkintöjen uudet säännöt ovat olennaisia, jotta voidaan estää ne ongelmat, jotka syntyvät silloin, kun kuluttajille ei tarjota riittävästi tietoa tuotteista. Tämän vuoksi lainsäädäntöä on päivitetty ja uudet säännöt astuneet voimaan. Uudet säännökset kattavat erilaiset tekstiilikiuista valmistetut tuotteet, kuten vaatteet, kodin tekstiilit, jalkineet ja asusteet. Näiden tekstiilituotteiden raaka-aineiden alkuperä sekä valmistustiedot tulee esittää selvästi tuotteen merkinnöissä. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi, että tuotteen valmistuksessa käytettyjen kuitujen osuudet on ilmoitettava prosenttiosuuksina ja tuotteen valmistusmaan tulee olla selkeästi esillä. Näiden tietojen avulla kuluttajat voivat tehdä paremmin informoituja ostopäätöksiä ja välttää mahdollisten allergioiden, ihon ärsytyksen tai muiden haitallisten terveysvaikutusten aiheuttamat ongelmat, jotka voivat johtua esimerkiksi kuitujen laadusta, kemikaalien käytöstä tai eettisistä kysymyksistä, kuten lasten työvoiman käytöstä. Lisäksi tämä auttaa kuluttajia tunnistamaan eettisemmät ja ympäristöystävällisemmät vaihtoehdot ja ohjaa heitä suosimaan tällaisia tuotteita. Uusien sääntöjen avulla pyritään myös estämään harhaanjohtavia markkinointikäytäntöjä, jotka voivat vahingoittaa kuluttajien luottamusta ja aiheuttaa kilpailuvääristymiä markkinoilla.

Tarkemmin: Uudet tekstiiliproduktien mallinnusreitit (labeling rules) ovat erittäin tärkeitä siksi, että ne auttavat estämään monia ongelmia, jotka syntyvät samaan aikaan kun kuluttajat ovat huonosti tietoinensa tuotteista. Nämä mallinnusreitit sisältävät tietoja tuotteesta, kuten esimerkiksi siitä, mistä se on tehty, kuinka se on käytettävä ja siitä, mitä sen käyttömahdollisuuksista on ottaminen huomioon. Kun kuluttajat eivät ole tietoinensa tuotteiden sisällöstä tai käyttöehdoista, voivat seuraukset olla vakavakin laatua. Sellaisissa tapauksissa kuluttajien voi olla erittäin vaikeaa tehdä tietoja pohjaltaan tai valita tuotteita, jotka sopivat heidän tarpeisiinsa. Lisäksi, kun kuluttajat eivät ole tietoinensa vaarallisten tai epäkelpojen tuotteiden olemassaolosta, voivat he päättää ostaa sellaiset tuotteet, mikä saattaa johtua vaurioihin tai sairauksiin. Tämän vuoksi on uusien mallinnusreitien tärkeys hyvin selvä. He ne auttavat varmistamaan, että kuluttajat saavat tietoa, mitä he tarvitsevat, jotta voivat tehdä tietoja pohjaltaan ja valita tuotteita, jotka ovat turvalliset ja sopivat heidän tarpeisiinsa.

We have the equation: 0 = 2687 * n - 2666 * n - 147 First, let's look at the \\"n\\" terms. It's like combining groups of apples. We have 2687 apples (2687 * n) and 2666 apples (-2666 * n). We need to subtract these two sets of apples: (2687 apples) - (2666 apples) = 21 apples Now, let's simplify our equation: 0 = 21 * n - 147 Now, let's remove the -147 on the right side by adding 147: 0 + 147 = 21 * n 147 = 21 * n Finally, we need to find out how many times 21 apples can fit into 147 apples. To do this, we will divide 147 by 21: 147 ÷ 21 = 7 So, the value of \\"n\\" is: n = 7 And that's the answer! n = 7., Sure, let's solve this step by step! First, notice that the number 2666*n and 2687*n are almost the same, except for a difference of 21 (which is 2687 - 2666). So, we can rewrite the equation like this: 0 = 2687*n - 2666*n - 147 becomes: 0 = 21*n - 147 Now, our goal is to isolate n, which means getting it by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, first, we need to get rid of the -147 on the right side. We can do this by adding 147 to both sides: 0 + 147 = 21*n - 147 + 147 which simplifies to: 147 = 21*n Next, to get n by itself, we need to undo the multiplication by 21. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 21: 147 ÷ 21 = (21*n) ÷ 21 which simplifies to: n = 7 And that's the solution! The value of n that makes the equation true is n = 7.,Hello little one! Let's solve this math problem step by step so you can understand it easily. Here's the original problem: 0 = 2687 * n - 2666 * n - 147. First, let me explain what that means. It's like having 2687 toys and sharing them with \\"n\\" number of friends, then taking away 2666 toys shared with the same \\"n\\" friends and 147 more toys. We need to find out the value of \\"n\\" to make everything even. Now let's solve it step by step: 1. We have 2687 * n and 2666 * n, both with the same \\"n\\", so we can subtract them. (2687 - 2666) * n. 2. Subtracting the numbers: 21 * n. So now we have: 0 = 21 * n - 147. 3. To make it easier, let's add 147 to both sides: 147 = 21 * n. 4. Finally, let's find \\"n\\" by dividing both sides by 21: n = 147 ÷ 21. 5. When we divide 147 by 21, we get 7. So, n = 7. And that's it! In this math problem, n equals 7.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Math problem: Solve -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 for h. What is the solution?","candidates_completions":"To solve the given equation, -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0, for h, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with h. Since the first two terms both have h as their variable, we can combine them: -51*h + 85*h = 34*h. So, the equation becomes: 34*h - 102 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable, h. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term (-102) from the left side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 102 to both sides of the equation: 34*h - 102 + 102 = 0 + 102 34*h = 102 Step 3: Solve for h by dividing by the coefficient of h. Now, we need to isolate h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h, which is 34: 34*h / 34 = 102 / 34 h = 3 So, the solution to the equation -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 is h = 3., Sure! I'd be happy to help you solve this linear equation for h. First, let's simplify the equation by combining the terms with h: -51h + 85h - 102 = 0 34h - 102 = 0 Next, we'll add 102 to both sides to isolate the h term: 34h - 102 + 102 = 0 + 102 34h = 102 Finally, we'll divide both sides by 34 to solve for h: h = 102 / 34 h = 3 So, the solution to the equation -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 is h = 3. We can verify this by plugging h=3 back into the original equation: -51*3 + 85*3 - 102 = -153 + 255 - 102 = 0 Therefore, h = 3 is the correct solution to the given equation.,The given problem is a linear equation that we need to solve for the variable h. The equation is: -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 To solve this equation, first, combine the like terms of the equation. In this case, we have two terms with the same variable, h. -51*h and 85*h Add these two terms together: (-51 + 85) * h = 34*h So now, our equation becomes: 34*h - 102 = 0 To isolate the variable h, first, we need to eliminate the constant term on the right side of the equation. To do this, add 102 to both sides of the equation: 34*h - 102 + 102 = 0 + 102 This simplifies to: 34*h = 102 Now, to solve for h, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 34: h = 102 / 34 Further simplification yields: h = 3 So, the solution to the equation -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 is h = 3."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which one reservations was in South Dakota and Nebraska Great Sioux Reservation or Cheyenne River Indian Reservation? Answer:","candidates_completions":"Step 1: Identify the question's requirements To answer this question, I need to determine which of the two reservations mentioned (Great Sioux Reservation or Cheyenne River Indian Reservation) was in South Dakota and Nebraska. Step 2: Research the locations of the reservations I will now find information about the locations of both the Great Sioux Reservation and the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Step 3: Assess the information After researching, I found that the Great Sioux Reservation was located in parts of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska. The Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, on the other hand, is entirely within the state of South Dakota. Step 4: Select the correct reservation Since the question asks for a reservation in South Dakota and Nebraska, the Great Sioux Reservation is the appropriate choice, as it is present in both states while the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation is only in South Dakota. Answer: The reservation in South Dakota and Nebraska is the Great Sioux Reservation.,To answer this question, I'll research the locations of both the Great Sioux Reservation and Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Then I will compare the locations and identify which one is in South Dakota and Nebraska. Step 1: Research the location of the Great Sioux Reservation. According to my research, the Great Sioux Reservation was a large area in the midwestern United States that included parts of present-day South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota before being divided into smaller reservations in the late 19th century. Step 2: Research the location of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. According to my research, the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation is a Native American reservation located in South Dakota and is home to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Based on the information I have found, the Great Sioux Reservation was in South Dakota and Nebraska as well as other locations, whereas the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation is only in South Dakota. Therefore, the answer is the Great Sioux Reservation., To answer this question, I would first need to gather some background information on the Native American reservations located in South Dakota and Nebraska. Step 1: Conduct background research on Native American reservations in South Dakota and Nebraska. From my research, I found that the Great Sioux Reservation and the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation are both located in South Dakota. However, the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation does extend slightly into the northwestern corner of Nebraska. Step 2: Determine which reservation meets the criteria described in the question. Based on the information gathered in Step 1, I can conclude that the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation is the correct answer since it is located in both South Dakota and Nebraska. The Great Sioux Reservation is not a correct answer because it is not located in Nebraska, even though it is in South Dakota. In summary, the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation is in both South Dakota and Nebraska."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Problem:Passage: The Mozart family grand tour was a journey through western Europe, undertaken by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences. The first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766. The material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician. Question: What location did the touring musician family return to at the end of the tour?

Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Next, it is essential that the decisions taken by the G20 are delivered rapidly. Romanian:","candidates_completions":"În continuare, este esențial ca deciziile luate de G20 să fie puse în aplicare rapid. Steps: 1. Identify the main elements of the sentence: \\"Next,\\" \\"essential,\\" \\"decisions taken by the G20,\\" \\"delivered rapidly.\\" 2. Translate each element: - \\"Next\\" -> \\"În continuare\\" - \\"essential\\" -> \\"esențial\\" - \\"decisions taken by the G20\\" -> \\"deciziile luate de G20\\" - \\"delivered rapidly\\" -> \\"puse în aplicare rapid\\" 3. Assemble the elements in the correct order, considering Romanian syntax: \\"În continuare, este esențial ca deciziile luate de G20 să fie puse în aplicare rapid.\\",Pas cu pas, în următorul pași, este esențial ca deciziile luate de G20 să fie implementate rapid. Rationale: - \\"Next\\" is translated as \\"în următorul pași\\" because it implies the sequence of actions or events. - \\"it is essential\\" translates to \\"este esențial\\" as this phrase is a subject-verb structure, emphasizing the importance of something. - \\"that the decisions taken\\" is translated as \\"ca deciziile luate\\" because it introduces the subject matter of discussion (the G20 decisions). - \\"by the G20\\" is rendered as \\"de G20\\" since it indicates the source or person responsible for the decisions. - \\"are delivered rapidly\\" is translated as \\"să fie implementate rapid\\" to express the urgency and need for quick action., \\"Este esențial să se livreze rapid deciziile luate de G20.\\" Justification: 1. Identify the subject and the action in the sentence: The subject is \\"decisions taken by the G20\\" and the action is \\"to deliver\\". 2. Translate the subject: \\"deciziile luate de G20\\" - this is straightforward, as \\"deciziile\\" means \\"decisions\\", \\"luate\\" means \\"taken\\" and \\"de\\" is used to indicate possession. G20 is a proper noun and remains the same. 3. Translate the action: \\"to deliver\\" in Romanian is \\"a livra\\" or \\"a se livra\\" when used as a passive form, which is appropriate here as we're talking about decisions being delivered. The passive form is more suitable because it's not explicitly stating who is doing the delivering. 4. Translate the adverb: \\"rapidly\\" in Romanian is \\"rapid\\". However, when used before a verb, it should be \\"rapidmente\\". But, in this context, it should be \\"rapid\\" because it modifies the adjective \\"delivered\\". 5.

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs).

The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2. - Kirkwall is the largest town and capital of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The town is first mentioned in \\"Orkneyinga saga\\" in the year 1046 when it is recorded as the residence of Rögnvald Brusason the Earl of Orkney, who was killed by his uncle Thorfinn the Mighty. In 1486, King James III of Scotland elevated Kirkwall to the status of a royal burgh; modern roadsigns still indicate \\"The City and Royal Burgh of Kirkwall\\". - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds. - Health food is food considered beneficial to health in ways that go beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. No human being being the same as any other, different dietary practices can be considered healthy by different people. - Bere , pronounced \`\` bear , '' is a six - row barley currently cultivated mainly on 5 - 15 hectares of land in Orkney , Scotland . It is also grown on Shetland , Caithness and on a very small scale by a few crofters on some of the Western Isles , i.e. North Uist , Benbecula , South Uist , Islay and Barra . It is probably Britain 's oldest cereal in continuous commercial cultivation . Bere is a landrace adapted to growing on soils of a low pH and to a short growing season with long hours of daylight , as found in the high latitudes of northern Scotland . It is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer . Because of its very rapid growth rate it is sown late but is often the first crop to be harvested . It is known locally as \`\` the 90 - day barley . '' - Caithness (, ; Old Norse: \\"Katanes\\") is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland. - South Uist is an island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. In the 2011 census it had a usually resident population of 1,754, a fall of 64 since 2001. There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found. The population is about 90% Roman Catholic. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. In 2006 South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotland's biggest community land buyout to date. In the north west there is a missile testing range. Its inhabitants are known in Gaelic as \\"\\"Deasaich\\"\\" (Southerners). - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

A:","candidates_completions":"A: Human evolution shows that evolutionary changes typically occur at a slow pace, often taking place over thousands or even millions of years. These changes occur through natural selection and genetic variations, and are influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, genetic drift, and mutation rate.,A: Evolutionary changes typically occur at a gradual pace over long periods of time, although the rate of change might vary depending on the specific evolutionary pressures and circumstances., Evolution, by its very nature, is a slow and gradual process that occurs over very long periods of time. It's often measured in terms of generations, which for humans might be thousands of years. This is because the mechanisms of evolution, such as natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow, rely on the randomness of genetic variation and the survival and reproduction of individuals. However, it's important to note that the pace of evolution can vary widely depending on the specific environmental pressures, the size of the population, and the amount of genetic variation present. Sometimes, evolutionary changes can occur more rapidly, such as in cases of artificial selection or when a population is suddenly introduced to a new environment.

A beautiful girl with a master's degree went through a lot of challenges and her name was on the list. In the final stage she faced an interview together -with another girl. Both of them were outstanding , not only in looks but also in education. The girl was successful in the interview. It seemed that she would get the chance. At last the examiner asked her, \\"Can you come to the office next Monday?\\" Shocked by the unexpected question, the beautiful girl couldn't make a decision at the moment, so she said, \\"I have to talk with my parents before I give an answer. \\" The examiner felt surprised but said calmly, \\"If so, let' s wait till you are ready. \\" The next day, the girl came to tell the examiner that her parents had agreed to let her begin work next Monday. But the examiner said regretfully , \\"Sorry, another suitable candidate has got the job. You had better try another place. \\"The beautiful girl was surprised. She asked for an explanation and was told, \\"What is needed here is a person who knows her own mind. \\" That was how a good opportunity _ a beautiful girl ran away. We can learn from the passage that _ A) the company lost its best clerk B) no girl got the job C) the other girl who failed at the last interview might get the job D) the examiner was very pleased with the girl A:","candidates_completions":"The passage illustrates a situation in which a beautiful girl with a master's degree was competing for a public relation clerk position at a famous foreign company in China. Among the applicants, the girl and another outstanding candidate reached the final stage of the interview process. Both candidates had excellent qualifications, not only in terms of their appearance but also in terms of their education. The girl had performed exceptionally well throughout the interview and seemed poised to secure the position. However, when the examiner asked her if she could start working the following Monday, she hesitated, stating that she needed to consult with her parents before giving an answer. The examiner expressed surprise at her response but agreed to wait for her decision. The next day, the girl returned to report that her parents had granted her permission to begin work on the scheduled date. However, the examiner regretfully informed her that the position had been offered to another suitable candidate. Although the girl was surprised and requested an explanation, she was ultimately given a valuable lesson to take away from the experience. The examiner explained that the company was looking for someone who knew their own mind, which the girl had failed to demonstrate during the interview. As a result, a good opportunity had slipped through her fingers, and she would need to search for employment elsewhere. Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that option C) the other girl who failed at the last interview might get the job is the most plausible answer. The text states that \\"another suitable candidate\\" had been offered the position, which could likely be the other girl who had reached the final stage of the interview alongside the beautiful girl., The passage describes a scenario where a famous foreign company in China is hiring a clerk for its public relation department. A beautiful girl with a master's degree made it to the final stage of the interview, where she competed with another outstanding girl. Despite her qualifications and performance in the interview, the beautiful girl hesitated when asked if she could come to the office the following Monday, as she needed to consult with her parents first. The examiner took this as a sign of uncertainty and, by the time the girl returned with her parents' approval, the job had already been offered to another candidate who was perceived as more decisive. Based on the information provided, we can infer that: A) the company lost its best clerk - This statement is not necessarily true. While the beautiful girl may have been highly qualified, the passage does not provide enough information to determine if she was the best candidate for the job. B) no girl got the job - This is true, as the job was offered to another candidate before the beautiful girl could accept the position. C) the other girl who failed at the last interview might get the job - This statement is plausible, as the examiner mentioned that another suitable candidate had already been hired. D) the examiner was very pleased with the girl - This statement is not supported by the passage. In fact, the examiner appeared to be disappointed with the beautiful girl's inability to make a decision promptly. Therefore, the correct answer is B) no girl got the job.,The passage tells us a story about a highly acclaimed and sought-after company in China seeking to fill a position for a clerk within their public relations department. Despite having more than one qualified candidate, they needed to select one for this role. This task was exhaustive for everyone involved, and two highly educated and visibly appealing contenders stood their ground at the very end of the lengthy process. From the details given in the passage, we do not find any information pertaining to this company having lost their best clerk, so option A is incorrect. Likewise, option B, stating that no girl got the job also does not align with the provided details. As the story progresses and the recruiter tosses the question before the top stage two contenders, one of the girls is so astonished by the unexpected question that she independently requires approval from her parents before making a choice. Though this might technically provide the company with essential time to rethink their decision, the idea of the company agreeing to wait until she was taken up with her indecisiveness is overarching enough to influence the final decision. Here is where the importance of decisiveness comes into play. When the girl ultimately returns confirming that she was ready, it's suggested that the marketer was apologetic but firmly said, \\"Sorry, another suitable candidate has got the job. You had better try another place.\\" This response confirms option C, suggesting that the other girl, who had vanished in the previous round of interviewing might have indeed gotten the job. Through this story, we understand that companies appreciate independence, promptness, firmness of decision-making. The phrase \\"a person who knows her own mind\\" indicates that an individual who is confident and can make decisions independently is preferable over someone who hesitates and requires more opinion and advice from external parties, especially at moments when quick decisive reactions are key. As for the last option, D, the passage starkly narrates that the employer was 'regretfully' responsive, hinting at their uneasy impression. It does not signify to be 'very pleased with the girl,' as mentioned in this option. Therefore, based on the information provided in the story, none of these options can be regarded as the perfect answer. But based on the information given, the most accurate inference we can make is C) the other girl who failed at the last interview might get the job. Nevertheless, it's essential to remember that this inference is surrounded by speculation because the passage does not explicitly provide a crystal clear answer, thus implying that more information and context are needed to derive a definitive conclusion."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Context: Robin felt her way around the room with her hands and her nose.

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

I decided to help my neighbors with their chores in exchange for some extra dollars. I washed cars, mowed lawns, and even walked dogs for many days, always with a big smile on my face. One sunny day, after collecting enough money from my jobs, I finally had enough to buy the car from my friend. So, I ran to him excitedly and handed over the money. He was really happy for me and handed me the keys to the shiny car. Now that I had the car, I could drive my family and friends on fun trips and have picnic at the park.

My friend was very kind, and she did not want me to be sad, so she said, \\"Don't worry, I'll help you find a way to get your own car.\\" She told me that I should start saving my pocket money, so I began to collect all the quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that I found on the ground or got from doing chores and placing them in my piggy bank. Every week, I counted all my money and told my friend how much I had saved. She would smile and tell me, \\"You're doing a great job! Keep up the hard work!\\" After a few months, I realized that I had saved a lot of money, but I still needed more. My friend suggested that we could plant some flowers in her garden, and for every flower we sold, we would split the money between us. Every weekend, we would go to the market and sell our colorful and pretty flowers. People loved seeing how excited we were about growing things, so many people bought our flowers and wished us luck in our journey to get a car. It took us over a year, but eventually, we had saved enough money! My friend and I happily went to the car shop together to select a car that fit our budget, and we found the perfect one for me. Next, we financed the car for a few years, which means we made regular payments to the car shop until it was fully paid for. Finally, after a lot of time, hard work, and support from my friend, I was able to purchase the car of my dreams! We celebrated with a big pizza party and drove in my new car, waving to all our friends and family as we drove around the neighborhood.

Viscount Mabrey, who wants to get Lord Devereaux on the throne of Genovia, plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve her engagement with Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth. Nicholas manipulates situations where he appears as a compassionate and charming person, making it hard for Mia to resist his charm.

Write an article based on this summary: Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has confirmed that a third bid from Rangers for Scott Allan has been rejected.","candidates_completions":"Title: Hibernian Rejects Third Bid from Rangers for Scott Allan Introduction Hibernian manager, Alan Stubbs, has confirmed that the Scottish football club has rejected a third bid from Rangers for their star midfielder, Scott Allan. This move showcases Hibernian's commitment to retain Allan despite continued interest from one of the country's top clubs. 1. Background of Rangers' Interest in Scott Allan Rangers have been keeping a close eye on Scott Allan due to his impressive performances for Hibernian since joining the club in 2014. Allan's excellent midfield skills and consistency in gameplay have caught the attention of Rangers, and they have been attempting to bring the player over to their team for quite some time now. 2. Previous Bids from Rangers This is not the first time Rangers have placed a bid to acquire Scott Allan. They have previously made two unsuccessful bids, and Hibernian has remained steadfast in their decision to not let go of their valued midfielder. Rangers' management, however, has not been deterred and has continued to express interest in signing Allan. 3. Hibernian's Firm Stance on Keeping Allan Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has demonstrated unwavering support for Allan, repeatedly stating that the club has no intention of selling him. Stubbs believes that Allan is an integral part of the club's success and losing him would be a significant blow to the team. Consequently, Stubbs is ensuring that Allan remains with Hibernian and continues to contribute to their journey in Scottish football. 4. Implications of the Rejected Bid The rejection of this third bid from Rangers only heightens the tension between the two clubs, as Rangers may be feeling growing frustration with Hibernian's refusal to negotiate. This could potentially lead to an even more substantial bid from Rangers in an attempt to secure Allan's transfer. However, it also demonstrates Hibernian's determination to maintain their player despite the lucrative offers they are receiving. 5. Future Possibilities for Scott Allan With three bids rejected, it remains uncertain how Rangers' pursuit of Scott Allan will unfold in the future. If Rangers continue to intensify their efforts, it could put pressure on Hibernian to reconsider their stance on keeping Allan. However, the player's future will ultimately be determined by the decisions of both clubs and the outcome of ongoing negotiations. Conclusion In summary, Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has confirmed that the club has rejected a third bid from Rangers for their star midfielder Scott Allan. This move highlights the club's unwavering commitment to retaining Allan, despite the strong interest from one of the top Scottish football clubs. As Rangers remain persistent in their pursuit, the future of both clubs and the player remains uncertain.,Article Title: Hibernian Manager Alan Stubbs Rejects Third Bid from Rangers for Scott Allan Introduction: Hibernian Football Club Manager Alan Stubbs has recently confirmed that the club has rejected a third bid from Glasgow-based rival Rangers for talented midfielder Scott Allan. This article will discuss the reasons behind the rejection, the possible implications for both clubs, and the future of the contentious transfer saga. Step 1: Explain the importance of rejected Rangers' bids for Scott Allan Recently, the Scottish football world has witnessed a highly competitive transfer battle between Glasgow Rangers and Hibernian for the services of talented Scottish midfielder, Scott Allan. Now in its third instance, Hibs' manager, Alan Stubbs, has confirmed the rejection of a bid from Rangers. This is a significant event, as the ongoing dispute between the two rivals is indicative of the fiercely contested nature of each club furthering its interests, irrespective of domestic rivalry. Step 2: Discuss the potential reasons for Hibernian's decision to reject Rangers' bids The reasons behind Hibernian's rejection of Rangers' latest bid may arise from various factors. First, the pricehaps Hibs believes that the fee offered by Rangers does not meet the player's market value or the club's demands. Second, keeping Scott Allan at Hibs may signal the club's determination to retain its most valuable assets, especially when it comes to denying a rival, especially for a player as important as Allan. Step 3: Analyze the impact of the rejected bid on both Rangers and Hibernian The rejection of a third bid by Hibernian could potentially have implications for both clubs. For Rangers, this would indicate a perceived lack of commitment from the club or a lack of strategic vision when it comes to player transfers. Alternatively, this could embolden Rangers to make another, possibly increased, offer in an effort to continue their pursuit of Allan in earnest. For Hibernian, such persistence from Rangers could impact the club's decision-making process going forward. Should a fourth or even higher bid be forthcoming, it could force Hibs to re-evaluate how much effort they should dedicate in retaining Allan due to the potential financial reward it could provide. Step 4: Discuss possible outcomes of the transfer saga There are several possible outcomes that may play out in the evolving transfer saga. If Rangers successfully drives up the bidding, they could eventually secure the services of Scott Allan, leading to a significant boost in depth and quality in their squad. However, should Hibs manage to retain Allan, it could potentially indicate the strength of the bond between player and club and further heighten the competitive rivalry between the two. Lastly, if the situation changes and no further bid is made by Rangers, both clubs would be required to find alternative methods of strengthening their respective teams during the ongoing transfer window. Conclusion: The ongoing transfer saga between Rangers and Hibernian for Scott Allan remains unpredictable, with several possibilities on the horizon. As the deadline for the transfer window draws closer, fans and football enthusiasts will be keen on witnessing how this engaging chapter unfolds in the larger story of Scottish football., Title: The Saga of Scott Allan: Rangers' Third Bid Rejected by Hibernian Introduction: In the world of football, transfer sagas are commonplace, and the ongoing tug-of-war between Hibernian and Rangers for the coveted services of midfielder Scott Allan is no exception. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has recently confirmed that Rangers have had a third bid for the player rejected, indicating that a resolution to this saga remains elusive. In this article, we will analyze the situation step-by-step and provide a faithful account of the unfolding events. Step 1: Initial Interest and Bid Last month, Scottish Premiership giants Rangers initially expressed interest in signing Hibernian's star midfielder, Scott Allan. When a potential transfer target is identified, clubs typically conduct an evaluation based on the player's skill, potential, and previous performance data. After careful deliberation, Rangers tabled their first offer, which was, at that point, the opening salvo in the protracted negotiation between the two clubs. Step 2: The First Rejection In response to Rangers' first bid, Hibernian swiftly refused the offer, communicating that they valued Scott Allan at a higher price point. The first bid was likely lower than Hibernian's expectations, as the club would be reticent to lose a key player for a figure that doesn't accurately reflect his worth. It is common practice for an initial bid to be rejected, as it provides an opportunity for the offering club to adjust their financial evaluation and table a more fitting offer in the upcoming rounds of negotiations. Step 3: Subsequent Bids and Rejections Subsequent to Hibernian's dismissal of the initial bid, Rangers returned with two more offers, the third of which was confirmed by Alan Stubbs as recently rejected. A series of rejected bids indicate that Hibernian is not prepared to release Scott Allan at a price that Rangers deem reasonable, which might suggest that Hibernian values the player beyond the financial reach of Rangers. Justification: At each step of the negotiation, both clubs have exhibited consistent behavior based on industry standards and the principles of supply and demand. Rangers have progressively increased their bids to indicate an escalating interest and a willingness to engage in more serious negotiations. Meanwhile, Hibernian has refused to grant their player's departure for a figure below their valuation, demonstrating a loyalty to a high-performing midfielder who is evidently well-regarded within their squad. Conclusion: The ongoing tussle between Hibernian and Rangers over Scott Allan illustrates the dynamic interplay between buyer and seller in the football transfer market. When an agreement between the two parties is not reached, it can lead to protracted negotiations, as seen in this case. At this stage, it remains uncertain whether Rangers will table another offer, or whether a different club may emerge as a potential suitor for the talented Hibernian midfielder. Regardless, the Scott Allan saga showcases the intriguing complexities of player transfers in professional football, highlighting the importance of strategic negotiations and financial evaluations for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally? A: Answer:","candidates_completions":"The term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally is \\"hemophilia.\\" This condition can lead to difficulties in stopping bleeding, making it potentially dangerous for those affected., The term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally is \\"hemophilia.\\" Hemophilia is a group of genetic disorders that are characterized by prolonged bleeding and impaired coagulation due to deficiencies or defects in certain coagulation factors, primarily Factor VIII in Hemophilia A and Factor IX in Hemophilia B. In hemophilia, the body's coagulation cascade of reactions is disrupted, leading to an increased risk of bleeding and difficulties in stopping the bleeding once it starts. Hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder, primarily affecting males as they inherit an affected X chromosome from a carrier mother. The gene responsible for Factor VIII, F8, is located on the X chromosome. Mutations in this gene result in the production of an abnormal version of the coagulation factor VIII protein or reduced amounts of it, leading to impaired blood clotting and the symptoms associated with hemophilia.,The term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally is Hemophilia. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impair the body's ability to create blood clots, a process which is needed to stop bleeding. This is caused by the deficiency of specific coagulation factors in the blood - special proteins that play a crucial role in blood clotting. These factors work in a specific sequence, known as the coagulation cascade, to form a clot and stop bleeding. Interestingly, when one or more of these clotting factors are deficient or missing, the coagulation cascade cannot function properly, causing prolonged or excessive bleeding. There can be different types of hemophilia, defined by the specific coagulation factor that is missing. For instance, Hemophilia A, the most common form of the disease, is caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII. This deficiency arises due to mutations in the F8 gene - the gene responsible for the production of Factor VIII protein. These mutations either lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or diminish the amount of the protein. As a result, the affected person's blood has difficulty clotting effectively, which can lead to prolonged bleeding after injury. Hemophilia is a genetic condition usually inherited from parents to their children and is linked to the X-chromosome. Because of this, it predominantly affects males. Nonetheless, it's crucial to note that the severity of hemophilia can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of the clotting factors in the blood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle?, what is it ?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.

Please include in your answer how the prevalence of 'Ashkenazi genes' is maintained and how this aids researchers in their studies.\\" A good answer would include the following points: 1. The 2006 study found that Ashkenazi Jews form a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup, meaning they share a similar genetic makeup despite their geographical origins. This is due to the historical Jewish population's endogamy, or the practice of marrying within the group. 2. The passage mentions Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, who continue the practice of marrying exclusively within the Ashkenazi Jewish community. This endogamous practice helps keep Ashkenazi genes prevalent among the population. 3. The large families often found in these Haredi Jewish communities allow researchers to study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. The continuation of endogamy among these groups provides researchers an opportunity to further investigate and understand the genetic makeup of Ashkenazi Jews.,Question: Based on the passage, what evidence supports the classification of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group, and how do trends among Haredi Jews contribute to the study of Ashkenazi genes?

Question: What language does Sindhu translate Tyagaraja keerthanam to? Movie title: Sindhu Bhairavi Movie plot: J.K. Balaganapathy (Sivakumar), popularly known as JKB, is a gifted carnatic musician but his wife Bhairavi (Sulakshana), despite her love and loyalty, fails to satisfy or challenge him intellectually. For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, and he is a compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth. Sindhu (Suhasini), working as a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate.

Balaganapathy, a gifted carnatic musician, his relationship with his wife Bhairavi, and the influence of their friends and colleagues, including Sindhu, on their lives., Based on the information provided, I can help you answer some questions regarding the film \\"Sindhu Bhairavi\\" that may assist you in deciding if it's worth investing in this film proposal. Question: What language does Sindhu translate Tyagaraja keerthanam to? Answer: Sindhu translates the Tyagaraja keerthanam from Telugu, a South Indian language, to Tamil, another South Indian language. She does this to help the audience understand the meaning of the song, as some members of the audience were speaking to each other during the performance instead of listening to the music. Justification: In the movie plot, Sindhu attended one of JKB's concerts and noticed that some people were not fully engaged in the performance. After JKB performed a Tyagaraja keerthanam in Telugu, Sindhu recognized the opportunity to increase the audience's appreciation of the performance by translating it to Tamil. When she successfully demonstrated her command over the translation, the audience responded positively. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Identify the source language: Tyagaraja keerthanam, a Carnatic music composition, is first sung in Telugu by JKB during the concert. 2. Identify the target language: As the movie plot mentions, Sindhu translates the keerthanam into Tamil, a language widely spoken in South India. 3. Recognize the purpose: By understanding the context in which the translation took place, one can infer that the purpose was to enhance the audience's experience, as some people were speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. 4. Infer the outcome: The outcome of Sindhu's translation was positive, as the audience applauded her, highlighting the increase in their appreciation of the performance. When deciding if it's worth investing in this film proposal, other aspects to consider might be the film's target audience, the positive reception the translation scene received, and the intellectual camaraderie between Sindhu and JKB that formed after her translation. These aspects may indicate the potential for a well-received film that explores themes of intellectual relationships and the role of music in connecting people.,Sindhu translates Tyagaraja keerthanam from Telugu to Tamil in the movie Sindhu Bhairavi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. John was combining chemicals in his lab one day. If he were to decrease the temperature in his lab, what would happen to the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments increase or decrease? A:","candidates_completions":"If John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments would generally decrease. This is because chemical weathering and reactions, as a rule of thumb, become slower as the temperature drops. Temperature plays a crucial role in the rate of chemical reactions. The higher the temperature, the more energy is available for the molecules to collide, which can break their existing bonds and form new ones. When the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants also increases. As a result, they move more vigorously and collide with one another more frequently. These collisions enhance the possibility of successful reactions, thus accelerating the rate of chemical reactions. In contrast, when the temperature decreases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants is diminished. This, in turn, results in less vigorous motion and a reduced frequency of collisions between the reactants. As a consequence, the possibility of successful reactions decreases, and the rate of chemical reactions slows down. However, it is essential to note that some reactions may not be significantly affected by temperature changes or may display atypical behavior. This largely depends on the specific reactants involved and the conditions under which the reactions occur. Most of the time, though, lowering the temperature causes a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions. In John's case, by decreasing the temperature in his lab, he should expect a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions occurring in his experiments. Consequently, his experiments may take longer to complete, and his results might differ from those obtained under higher temperature conditions. Ultimately, the precise effect of lowering the temperature on John's experiments will depend on the specific chemical reactions he is studying and the temperature range involved., If John decreases the temperature in his lab, the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments would decrease. This is because chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, the molecules involved in the reaction have more kinetic energy, which allows them to collide more frequently and with greater force. These more energetic collisions increase the likelihood that the reactants will undergo a chemical transformation, leading to a faster reaction rate. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the molecules have less kinetic energy, which results in fewer and less energetic collisions, and therefore a slower reaction rate. So, if John wants to slow down the chemical reactions in his lab, decreasing the temperature would be a good way to do it.,A: If John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments would decrease. As stated in the initial information provided, chemical weathering increases as temperature increases. This observation is based on the fact that chemical reactions generally proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. When comparing the process of both weathering and laboratory chemical reactions, the principle remains the same; the rate of reactions is influenced by the temperature of the reaction environment. In John's lab, the temperature serves as a crucial factor that affects the rate of the chemical reactions occurring. Lower temperatures usually lead to a slower rate of these reactions, whereas higher temperatures generally result in a faster rate of reactions. When the temperature is decreased, the kinetic energy of the molecules in the reaction system will be reduced. This leads to less frequent, and generally lower-energy collisions between the reacting molecules. As a consequence, the rate at which these molecules can interact, form chemical bonds, or undergo other chemical changes is slowed down. In summary, decreasing the temperature in John's lab would result in a reduction of the rate of chemical reactions, making the reactions proceed at a slower pace as compared to if the temperature were higher."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Hummingbirds are birds from the Americas that constitute the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g). - Mitrospingus is a genus of bird formerly in the family Thraupidae . Established by Robert Ridgway in 1898 , it contains the following species : Dusky - faced tanager ( Mitrospingus cassinii ) Olive - backed tanager ( Mitrospingus oleagineus ) The name Mitrospingus is a combination of the Greek words mitra meaning \`\` cap '' or \`\` head - dress '' and spingos , meaning \`\` finch '' . - The ostrich or common ostrich (\\"Struthio camelus\\") is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus \\"Struthio\\", which is in the ratite family. In 2014, the Somali ostrich (\\"Struthio molybdophanes\\") was recognized as a distinct species. What is the relationship between 'mitrospingus' and 'the americas'? Answer:","candidates_completions":"The relationship between 'mitrospingus' and 'the Americas' is that mitrospingus refers to a genus of bird species included in the family Thraupidae, which are found in the Americas. The family Thraupidae consists of tanagers, which are small to medium-sized birds found primarily in the neotropical region, which includes North, Central, and South America. Mitrospingus includes two species: the dusky-faced tanager (Mitrospingus cassinii) and the olive-backed tanager (Mitrospingus oleagineus), both of which are indigenous to the Americas.,There is no direct relationship between 'Mitrospingus' and 'the Americas.' Mitrospingus is a genus of birds, which includes species like the Dusky-faced Tanager (Mitrospingus cassinii) and Olive-backed Tanager (Mitrospingus oleagineus). These birds are not specifically related to 'the Americas,' as the term refers to a group of hummingbirds native to the Americas, which are distinct from the Mitrospingus genus. The relationship between Mitrospingus and the Americas can be understood through the broader context of the diverse bird species found in the regions of North, Central, and South America. Both hummingbirds and Mitrospingus belong to the avian species characteristic of the Americas, but they are different types of birds that belong to separate families and genera., The genus of bird named 'Mitrospingus' has a relationship with 'The Americas' because all the species that belong to this genus are native to this region. The Mitrospingus genus contains two species, the Dusky-faced Tanager (Mitrospingus cassinii) and the Olive-backed Tanager (Mitrospingus oleagineus). Both of these species are found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Therefore, the 'Mitrospingus' genus is a part of the avian fauna of the Americas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer provided discusses possible correlations between pedophilia and neurological abnormalities, as well as other psychological conditions, but it does not provide information about the age of a child pedophile. It's also important to note that pedophilia is a criminal behavior and it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with minors. The focus should be on preventing and addressing this harmful behavior, rather than speculating about the age of individuals who engage in it.,Step 1: Read the question and suggested answer carefully. - The question is: \\"how old a child pedophile crime\\", which appears to be grammatically incorrect and unclear in meaning.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the real name of the person whose father brought home a collection of American 45s?, using the article: Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's.

Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another..., what would be the answer ?

Meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, lessen anxiety, and much more. If you’re looking for a way to rest without actually sleeping, meditation is a rewarding and mindful way of achieving that goal. Rather than laying on the coaching tossing and turning trying to feel rested, practicing meditation can actively improve your quality of rest. Work breaks into your day before you start to feel exhausted or overtired. If you keep pushing yourself until you actually start to feel awful, it will make it much harder to recover and feel rested. Work breaks into your life on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, and a yearly basis. Everyone needs time to recoup and recharge. This can be as easy as sitting outside for a few minutes before going back to work, taking one day to yourself a week, or a relaxing vacation. We all have a strong habit of discursive thinking, which means one thought flows to the next and then the next. This can be exhausting, and if you practice not thinking you can give your mind a valuable break. Open your senses to what is happening around you and pay attention, but don't think about them. Just experience them. When you find yourself drifting back into a line of thought, notice this and go back to paying attention to what you are experiencing. Sleeping is the one time when we are really able to give our minds a rest. Although meditation can help, sleeping is absolutely necessary to feel rested. Don't sacrifice sleep for other activities because the odds are they won't benefit your well being and happiness nearly as much as those extra hours will. Sounds like running water, birds chirping, and even storms can help you relax and stop stressing about whatever is going through your head. You can find playlists of these online.

Please answer the following question: This article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\".

Movie plot title: The Tree of Life Movie plot: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

This contrasts with the more loving and merciful approach of Jack's mother, played by Jessica Chastain.

Question: Which of the stars on Le Jaguar is also a professional poker player? Answer:","candidates_completions":"Le Jaguar is likely a misspelling or misinterpretation of a known entity in the context of stars and poker players. If one is talking about a TV show or movie named \\"Le Jaguar,\\" it is difficult to find any relevant resources to give a direct answer to this question since there isn't a prominent TV show or movie with that title. However, it might be useful to explore some celebrities who are both in the entertainment industry and have a background as professional poker players. One notable celebrity who fits this description is Jennifer Tilly, a talented actress and accomplished poker player. Tilly has appeared in movies such as Liar Liar (1997), Bound (1996), and The Seed of Chucky (2004). In addition to her acting career, she has had impressive success in the world of poker. Tilly began playing poker professionally in the early 2000s and has since won a World Series of Poker bracelet in 2005 and numerous other high-stakes tournaments. She is often seen participating in live events and televised poker games. Another celebrity with a poker background is Ben Affleck, who is known for his acting, directing, and writing skills, having appeared in and directed movies such as Good Will Hunting (1997), Argo (2012), and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Affleck is an avid poker player and has had some noteworthy accomplishments, including winning the California State Poker Championship in 2004. He has participated in numerous high-stakes games and other tournaments, demonstrating his proficiency in the game. A few other celebrities who have dabbled in professional poker include Tobey Maguire, Shannon Elizabeth, James Woods, and Michael Ian Black. Although their extent of success within the professional poker realm varies, each of these celebrities has demonstrated their interest and skill in the game. In conclusion, while it's unclear what \\"Le Jaguar\\" is meant to refer to, several celebrities excel both in the entertainment industry and as professional poker players. Among them, Jennifer Tilly and Ben Affleck stand out as highly accomplished in both fields.,Le Jaguar is a French-produced motion picture released in 1996, directed by Francis Veber, which depicts a series of absurd events involving a Parisian detective trying to solve a crime. The movie doesn't specifically have a character named \\"Le Jaguar.\\" Therefore, it is essential to clarify the question regarding the stars and context before providing a detailed answer. In regards to professional poker players and actors, some familiar faces who have dabbled in both fields are: 1. James Woods: An accomplished actor who is well-known for his roles in films like Casino, Nixon, and Ghosts of Mississippi. He's also an avid poker player and has participated in many live poker tournaments, including the World Series of Poker (WSOP), having accumulated several six-figure cashes in WSOP events. 2. Ben Affleck: An awarded actor and filmmaker with notable performances in films such as Good Will Hunting, Argo, and Gone Girl. In addition, Ben Affleck is a professional poker player, and despite his consistent success, he faced a temporary ban at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel in Las Vegas for alleged card counting at blackjack tables. 3. Tobey Maguire: He is popularly known for his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the Spider-Man trilogy. Outside of acting, Tobey Maguire is a skilled poker player. Maguire participated in Hollywood's high-stakes underground poker games, featuring celebrities like Ben Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. However, he faced legal challenges concerning allegations of financing some of the illicit games. 4. Jennifer Tilly: Famous for her acting role in the film Bride of Chucky, Jennifer Tilly also made a name for herself in the poker world. She won the World Series of Poker Ladies' Tournament in 2005 and has been very active in the poker community since. To answer the original question, it’s not quite clear who the character \\"Le Jaguar\\" is referring to. However, based on the known intersection of actors and professional poker players, it is probable that no actor listed above appeared in Le Jaguar. As Le Jaguar is a French film, it is more likely that an actor from the French film industry might be involved in poker as well. But without further details on the context of the question, it's difficult to accurately identify such an individual.

The father, in an attempt to save his family, tries to hold the storm cellar door down, but gets sucked into the tornado and killed. Watching in horror are the man's wife and his daughter Jo, who, despite the horror of the storm and losing her father, is entranced by the funnel.The film cuts to the present day and meteorologists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) are discussing a building storm system over Oklahoma which could produce a record outbreak of tornadoes.Meanwhile, retired storm chaser Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) and his fiancée Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz) are heading out to meet Bills former storm-chasing team to get the final divorce papers from Bills soon to be ex-wife, Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) who, since the day her father died, has sworn to hunt down as many tornadoes as possible, not wanting the same fate to happen to someone else. Besides Jo, the team consists of the eccentric Dusty Davis (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Robert Rabbit Nurick (Alan Ruck) navigator, Laurence (Jeremy Davies) photographer, Joey (Joey Slotnick), Alan Sanders (Sean Whalen) Rabbits driver, Tim \\"Beltzer\\" Lewis (Todd Field), Haynes (Wendle Jospeher) who rides with Beltzer, and Jason \\"Preacher\\" Rowe (Scott Thomson).Jo, who is still in love with Bill, tries to stall because she does not want the marriage to end.

My question: What does the team adds from the soda cans? A:","candidates_completions":"In the movie \\"Twister,\\" the team led by Jo Harding and Bill Harding uses soda cans as a makeshift yet effective tool in their tornado-chasing and data-gathering mission. The soda cans are used as components in the \\"Dorothy\\" device, which is designed to measure and analyze tornadoes from the inside. Here's a more detailed explanation of how the soda cans are used: 1. Collecting data: The soda cans are filled with hundreds of tiny styrofoam balls. Once the \\"Dorothy\\" device is placed in the path of a tornado, the high-speed winds cause the styrofoam balls to scatter in all directions. By tracking the movement of these balls, the team can gather valuable data about the tornado's wind speed, direction, and other characteristics, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of these powerful natural phenomena. 2. Corn on the cob tube: In addition to the soda can method, the team also uses Corn on the Cob (COTC) tubes, which are modified soda cans with Corn on the Cob-like spirals lining their interiors. Once deployed, the COTC tubes record temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed data. The data is then retrieved by unwinding the spirals and analyzing the data points. By using these soda can-based methods, the team in \\"Twister\\" demonstrates the importance of both innovation and resourcefulness when faced with challenging scientific pursuits. In the context of the movie, the soda cans are a crucial element of the \\"Dorothy\\" devices, enabling the team to gather real-time data about tornadoes and ultimately advance the field of meteorology.,The team adds aluminum can winglets from the soda cans to the sensors inside \\"Dorothy.\\" These winglets are small, lightweight pieces cut from the aluminum cans, which are then attached to the individual sensors within the weather analyzing device. The purpose of these winglets is to help the sensors become airborne and stay inside the tornado when it comes into contact with \\"Dorothy.\\" By having the sensors be lightweight and easily caught and carried by the powerful winds, it allows the device to collect vital data from inside the tornado for a longer period of time. This data is crucial for the team's research on tornadoes, allowing them to better understand the inner workings of these natural disasters and, in turn, improve early warning systems to save lives. The addition of these soda can winglets is an ingenious and resourceful solution that helps the team overcome a significant obstacle in their mission to collect tornado data.,The team adds steel ball bearings to the soda cans in order to create the \\"Dorothy\\" weather machines. These steel ball bearings serve as sensors that will collect data about the tornado's internal structure and forces when the \\"Dorothy\\" machines are placed inside tornadoes. Combined with a transponder system, the ball bearings provide crucial information about the tornadoes' physical properties and create a more accurate model of their behavior, aiding in forecasting and early warning systems. This innovative method of data collection is a key aspect of the film's storyline, demonstrating the scientific ingenuity and dedication of the storm chasing team."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: The demand for diagnostic tools that allow simultaneous screening of samples for multiple pathogens is increasing because they overcome the limitations of other methods, which can only screen for a single or a few pathogens at a time. Microarrays offer the advantages of being capable to test a large number of samples simultaneously, screening for multiple pathogen types per sample and having comparable sensitivity to existing methods such as PCR. Array design is often considered the most important process in any microarray experiment and can be the deciding factor in the success of a study. There are currently no microarrays for simultaneous detection of rodent-borne pathogens. The aim of this report is to explicate the design, development and evaluation of a microarray platform for use as a screening tool that combines ease of use and rapid identification of a number of rodent-borne pathogens of zoonotic importance. Nucleic acid was amplified by multiplex biotinylation PCR prior to hybridisation onto microarrays. The array sensitivity was comparable to standard PCR, though less sensitive than real-time PCR. The array presented here is a prototype microarray identification system for zoonotic pathogens that can infect rodent species.

Given the question: Question: what causes photo red eye I found the following answer on Google: The effect appears in the eyes of humans and animals that have tapetum lucidum . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","candidates_completions":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, but it is not complete. Photo red-eye is a phenomenon that occurs in photography when light from the camera flash reflects off the retinas of human or animal subjects, causing their eyes to appear red or glowing in the captured image. The tapetum lucidum is a layer of reflective tissue found in the eyes of many nocturnal animals, which contributes to improved night vision by allowing the light to be reabsorbed by the photoreceptor cells. When a camera flash illuminates the eyes, the light reflects off the tapetum lucidum as well as the blood vessels in the retinas, creating the red-eye effect. However, the red-eye effect is not solely due to the presence of the tapetum lucidum, as humans do not have this reflective layer and still experience red-eye in photos. The primary cause of red-eye in humans is the reflection of light from the camera flash off the blood-rich retina at the back of the eye. Several factors can contribute to the red-eye effect: 1. Pupil size: In low-light conditions, the pupils dilate to allow more light to enter the eye. When the camera flash is bright and sudden, the pupils do not have enough time to constrict, causing more light to be reflected off the retina and resulting in the red-eye effect. 2. Angle of the flash: If the camera flash is positioned close to the lens and aimed directly at the subject's eyes, the chances of red-eye occurring are higher. To minimize red-eye, ensure the flash is at an angle to the subject or use an external flash that can be positioned away from the camera lens. 3. Camera settings and features: Many cameras offer red-eye reduction features that emit a brief pre-flash or series of flashes before capturing the photo. This causes the subject's pupils to constrict, thereby reducing the amount of light that can be reflected off the retina. 4. Distance to the subject: Red-eye is more likely to occur when the subject is close to the camera, as the amount of reflected light that reaches the camera sensor is higher. To minimize the red-eye effect, photographers can utilize red-eye reduction features, adjust camera angles, use off-camera or bounce flash, or increase the ambient light in the scene. Additionally, photo editing software can often be used to correct red-eye after the image has been captured.,Yes, the answer provided is correct. Photo red eye is caused by the presence of a special reflective layer in the eye called the tapetum lucidum. This layer can be found mainly in nocturnal animals as well as some humans with an underlying genetic condition. The tapetum lucidum serves the purpose of reflecting light that passes through the retina back into the eye. This helps capture more light, which aids the animals in seeing better in low light environments. However, when a camera takes a picture, the light from the camera flash can be reflected off this layer, creating a red reflection in the eyes of the photographed subject. The red appearance is due to the shorter wavelengths of light from the flash being absorbed, while the longer red wavelengths are reflected and scattered in the tapetum lucidum, resulting in the red glow seen in photographs. In humans, the red eye effect may also be due to the reflection of light from the retina and other structures in the eye, as these surfaces can also scatter some of the light entering the eye. To lessen or completely avoid the red eye effect in photographs, there are a number of techniques and camera functions that can be used, including reducing the flash power, using a diffuser or bounce flash, avoiding direct flash, or using continuous lighting., Yes, that answer is partially correct. The reddish reflection known as \\"red eye\\" in photographs is primarily caused by the flash of the camera reflecting off the retinas of the eyes. However, it is more likely to occur when taking pictures of people or animals that have a tapetum lucidum, which is a layer of tissue located behind the retina in the eye. This tissue reflects light back through the retina to enhance the light available to the photoreceptors, which can result in a more prominent red-eye effect in photographs. The tapetum lucidum is found in many animals, including cats, dogs, and other mammals, as well as some birds, reptiles, and fish. In contrast, humans and some other primates do not have a tapetum lucidum. However, even in humans, the red-eye effect can still occur in photographs taken in low light conditions, as the pupils can dilate to allow more light to enter the eye, increasing the likelihood of the red-eye effect. So while having a tapetum lucidum does increase the likelihood of red-eye in photographs, it is not the only factor that can cause this effect."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

Look up the regulation dartboard numbering layout. 2. Identify the position of numbers 9 and 11 on the dartboard. 3. Determine the number that is between them according to the layout. Step 1: Upon researching, I found that a regulation dartboard features the following numbering sequence (clockwise): 20, 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12, 5. Step 2: In the sequence, number 9 is positioned after number 11. Step 3: The number between 11 and 9 on a regulation dartboard is 14, as the sequence goes: 11, 14, 9., A regulation dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, with numbers 1 through 20 arranged in a clockwise order around the board's outer rim. The numbers increase in sequence as you move clockwise around the board. To answer your question, we need to find the number between 9 and 11. Since we're moving clockwise, the number we're looking for is directly to the right of 9. Let's go step-by-step: 1. We start at 1, then move to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 2. The number we're looking for is between 9 and 11, so we continue moving clockwise from 9. 3. The next number after 9 is 10, and then we reach 11.

Given the question: Before winning his first NBA championship with the warriors, who joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament? The answer is:","candidates_completions":"The 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament was won by the Saint Joseph's Hawks, who went on to have a successful season and made it to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. However, the question asks about a player who was part of the All-Championship team after that tournament and subsequently won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors. To answer this question, we need to look at players who were part of the Atlantic 10 Tournament in 2003 and later became NBA Champions with the Warriors. One such player is Jodie Meeks, who was a member of the 2003 Atlantic 10 All-Tournament team while playing for the University of Kentucky. Although Kentucky is not an Atlantic 10 Conference member, Meeks was named to the all-tournament team due to his exceptional performance during the tournament. Later, Meeks played for the Los Angeles Lakers, Detroit Pistons, Portland Trail Blazers, and then the Washington Wizards before joining the Toronto Raptors in 2019. In 2021, he signed a training camp deal with the Warriors and eventually became the 2022 NBA Champion with them. It is essential to mention that Meeks is the only player from the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament who later won an NBA championship with the Warriors. Other notable players from the 2003 Atlantic 10 Tournament who had successful NBA careers include Delonte West (Saint Joseph's), who won an NBA Championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011, and David West (Xavier), who was a two-time NBA All-Star and won NBA Championships with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018. However, they were not part of the All-Championship team in 2003.,Before winning his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, Jameer Nelson joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. Jameer Nelson, a talented point guard, played college basketball for the Saint Joseph's University Hawks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he had an illustrious career. He was a part of the Atlantic 10 Conference, a league known for producing numerous professional basketball players. In the 2002-03 season, Nelson helped lead the Saint Joseph's Hawks to an impressive performance in the regular season and eventually the Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. In the 2003 Atlantic 10 Tournament, the Hawks had a remarkable run, making it to the championship game against the University of Dayton Flyers. Throughout the tournament, Nelson showcased his exceptional basketball skills and leadership qualities that would later help him succeed in the NBA. Although the Hawks ultimately lost to Dayton in the championship game, Nelson's performance did not go unnoticed. As a result of his outstanding play and significant contributions to the team's success, Jameer Nelson was named to the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. This achievement added to his already impressive college basketball resume, which included being named the 2003-04 National College Player of the Year and a two-time consensus First Team All-American. Following his college career, Jameer Nelson was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft with the 20th overall pick. However, his draft rights were traded to the Orlando Magic, where he would spend the majority of his NBA career. Over the years, he developed into an All-Star caliber player, earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during the 2008-09 season. In 2018, Nelson achieved his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, adding a professional championship to his collection of basketball accomplishments. Despite not having a significant role on that championship team, his journey from starring in college basketball to achieving success in the NBA is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and passion for the sport.,Before winning his first NBA championship with the Warriors, the player who joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament is David West. David West is a retired American professional basketball player who played as a power forward. He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers in the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10), where he excelled and helped the team reach the Elite Eight during his junior season. This led to his solid performance during the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, and he was recognized for his contributions by being selected as one of the players in the All-Championship team. After achieving success in college basketball, David West entered the 2003 NBA Draft and was chosen by the New Orleans Hornets, where he spent his early professional years. It wasn't until 2014 that David West won his first NBA championship, with the Golden State Warriors, when he played alongside NBA legends such as Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, among others. Throughout his career, David West was known for his impressive basketball skills. Particularly notable are his rebounding, post-up game, and versatile scoring ability. He also demonstrated strong leadership qualities and an unselfish playing style that helped his teammates excel in the game. In summary, David West is the player who joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. Before becoming a crucial member of the Warriors' team that won the NBA championship in 2014, David West played college basketball and left a lasting impact in the A-10 Conference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

UPDATED:. 12:14 EST, 3 December 2013. A woman whose family was wiped out in a car crash said 'I lost my everybody' in the collision. Elber Twomey was the only survivor after the crash which took the lives of her husband, their son and their unborn child. The suicidal driver of the other vehicle was also killed. 'I lost my everbody': Elber Twomey criticises the police who she blames for causing the crash which killed her husband, her son and her unborn child in Torquay, Devon. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, said her family would still be alive if police hadn’t pursued the car of 26-year-old Marek Wojiechowski. Emergency services were contacted after he left his wife a suicide note, and when his car was spotted, an officer gave chase, switching on his flashing lights and siren. Wojiechowski then ‘deliberately’ drove straight into the Twomeys family’s VW Golf during their holiday in Torquay, Devon. Oisin Twomey, who was 16 months old, died at the scene. Crash scene: A father, a son and his wife's unborn child all died following this crash in Torquay, Devon, in July last year. Marek Wojiechowski deliberately crashed his vehicle into the Twomey family's VW Golf. Grief: Elber Twomey with her husband Con on their wedding day. He died 10 months after a crash which killed their toddler son. His father Con, 39, died later ten months later in hospital after suffering serious brain injuries. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was hospitalised for months and lost her unborn daughter, spoke after the inquest of her son and the Polish taxi-driver. She believes that police driver’s approach was ‘completely wrong’ and caused Wojiechowski to panic. Speaking on the last day of the inquest in Torquay, she said of the day of the crash in July 2012: ‘I lost my everybody. ‘Up to 2.46pm on July 6th I had not a care in the world. ‘I was on holiday with my darling husband and best friend Con, our beautiful little man, baba Oisin and our beautiful unborn daughter. At 2.47pm our wonderful life ended.’ She continued:’I will always be of the opinion that the manner in which the police dealt with Marek that horrific day was completely wrong. ‘I believe that a more cautious and considered response by the police is necessary to protect lives. The lack of this caution has cost me my entire family.’ She continued: ‘I believe it was a misjudgement by the police officer involved to request Marek to stop. ‘He was not driving erratically, he did not have his wife and children with him and he had not indicated that he would end his life by using his car. ‘While I don’t blame the police officer involved personally for my tragic story, I do blame the police service.’ The inquest heard that Wojiechowski had agreed to split with his wife Agnieszka and left a four-page suicide note. Accident victim: Oisin Twomey, aged 16 months, who died at the scene following the crash in Torquay, Devon, last year. She raised the alarm when she found the letter and CCTV cameras recorded him circling a roundabout and driving in a continuous two-mile loop. Police response driver PC Ben Bickford spotted a black car driving in the opposite carriageway and followed to see if it was Wojiechowski. Suicidal: Marek Wojciechowski who caused the crash which wiped out a young family. He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up and flashed his lights to signal the driver to pull over. PC Bickford told a previous hearing of the inquest: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence. ‘As we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.’ Wojiechowski, a former chef, was arrested at the scene but died from his injuries later that day in hospital. Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May this year. In a narrative verdict, a. jury of 10 said that both Oisin and Wojiechowski died because the. Pole had ‘suddenly steered his car across the road into the opposite. carriageway and accelerated into oncoming traffic in an attempt to. commit suicide.’ Coroner. for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon, Ian Arrow said the police officer. involved did all he could but he planned to write to the Association of. Chief Police Officers to ask for a review. He. said: ‘Particular review should be given to how police officers should. approach and deal with distressed or vulnerable individuals. It may. require further with health care professionals.’ Chief Superintendent and head of operations for Devon and Cornwall Police, Jim Nye, said after the inquest that the police officer acted appropriately and in line with national guidelines. Mrs Twomey said she rejected the findings of an IPCC report that said ‘no learning outcomes or organisational learning was identified’ from the tragedy. Highlights:","candidates_completions":"1.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece. John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film. Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same. Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the \\"clown\\" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?

The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and the Indus Valley Civilization in Ancient India (modern-day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What machinery has lead to the easily made and widespread use of cotton?","candidates_completions":"The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney was a major breakthrough that led to the easily made and widespread use of cotton. The cotton gin is a machine that quickly and easily separates cotton fibers from their seeds, a task that was previously done by hand and was labor-intensive and time-consuming. Before the invention of the cotton gin, cotton had to be picked by hand and then the seeds had to be removed from the cotton fibers by hand as well. This process was slow and required a lot of labor, making cotton a relatively expensive and less widely used fabric. The cotton gin revolutionized this process by allowing large quantities of cotton to be quickly and easily cleaned of seeds, making it much more cost-effective to produce cotton fabric. The invention of the cotton gin had a significant impact on the textile industry and the economy as a whole. It made cotton a more affordable and widely used fabric, which in turn led to an increase in the demand for cotton and the need for more cotton plantations. This had a number of economic and social consequences, including the growth of the slave trade in the United States as plantation owners sought to acquire more labor to work their cotton fields. In summary, the invention of the cotton gin was a major factor in the widespread and easy production of cotton, as it greatly reduced the time and labor required to clean cotton of its seeds. This made cotton a more affordable and widely used fabric, which had significant economic and social consequences.,The machinery that has led to the easily made and widespread use of cotton is the cotton gin, which was invented by American inventor Eli Whitney in the late 18th century. Before the invention of the cotton gin, cotton fibers had to be separated from their seeds by hand, a process that was slow and labor-intensive. This made cotton production expensive and limited the quantity that could be produced. However, the cotton gin revolutionized the process by mechanizing the separation of cotton fibers from their seeds. This greatly reduced the labor required, making cotton production more efficient and cost-effective. As a result, the cost of producing cotton cloth decreased, leading to an increase in its availability and widespread use. The cotton gin's impact on the textile industry was immense, as it played a crucial role in making cotton the most widely used natural fiber for fabric in clothing today. Since its invention, various improvements and innovations have been made to the cotton gin and other machinery, further enhancing the efficiency and productivity of cotton production.,The machinery that has led to the easily made and widespread use of cotton is the cotton gin. Invented by Eli Whitney in 1794, the cotton gin revolutionized the cotton industry by making the process of separating the cotton fibers from their seeds drastically quicker and easier. Before the invention of the cotton gin, cotton processing was an incredibly labor-intensive task that required many hours and a significant amount of manual work. Workers had to pick the cotton from the plants in the field, and then each individual seed had to be painstakingly separated from the cotton fibers by hand. Each cotton boll contains numerous seeds, each surrounded by the cotton fiber, making this task quite arduous and time-consuming. The cotton gin mechanized this process. The machine works by pulling the cotton through a series of wire teeth that remove the seeds from the fibers. The seeds fall through a slot in the bottom of the machine, allowing the fibers to be pulled through and wound onto a spindle. This mechanization greatly improved the efficiency of cotton processing, allowing it to be done on a much larger scale and at a much faster pace. Even though there were initial issues around the patent for the cotton gin, with numerous legal contests over who held the true rights to the invention, Eli Whitney’s machine had an enormous impact on the cotton industry. It reduced the cost of cotton production and made it affordable for more people. This led to a boom in the cotton industry, particularly in the southern United States where cotton was a major crop. As a result, cotton became more widely available and was used more extensively in textile manufacturing, leading to its predominance in the market. Moreover, the invention of the cotton gin led to further industrialization in the textile industry. Innovations such as the spinning jenny, the power loom, and the spinning mule came after the cotton gin and further mechanized the process of turning cotton into cloth. They allowed textiles to be produced much more quickly and cheaply, making them more accessible to a greater number of people and further promoting the widespread use of cotton. In sum, the invention of the cotton gin was instrumental in the widespread use of cotton as it made the processing of cotton far more efficient, drastically reducing the cost of production and enabling the mass production of cotton textiles. This crucial piece of machinery, along with later developments in textile machinery, revolutionized the textile industry and led to the dominance of cotton in the global textile market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: The Konbaung-Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end. How many Mon rebellions flared up between 1762 and 1826?","candidates_completions":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. We need to find out how many Mon rebellions occurred between the years 1762 and 1826. 2. The text mentions that there were Mon rebellions in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. 3. To find the number of rebellions, we simply need to count these instances. However, the rebellion in 1824-1826 actually covers a range of years, not a single year. So, it's not clear if this should be counted as one rebellion or several. If we consider it as one rebellion, then there were 5 rebellions between 1762 and 1826. If we consider each year in the 1824-1826 range as a separate rebellion, then there were 6 rebellions. Without further context, it's difficult to definitively determine the number of rebellions. However, based on the information provided, there were at least 5 Mon rebellions between 1762 and 1826.,In the provided text, five Mon rebellions are mentioned as having occurred between 1762 and 1826. They took place in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. To find this, I looked through the text for information related to the Mon rebellions during the specified timeline. The text clearly listed each year a rebellion occurred, making it relatively simple to count them.,To count the number of Mon rebellions that flared up between 1762 and 1826, I will go through the provided text to identify instances of Mon rebellions. 1. 1762 2. 1774 (two rebellions mentioned in this same year) - Rebellion in 1774 (mentioned as an example of a revolt that led to fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions) - The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774 (also related to the events in this year) 3. 1783 4. 1792 5. 1824-1826 From the provided text, I identified a total of 6 Mon rebellions that flared up between 1762 and 1826."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","candidates_completions":"In this task, my objective is to translate the given English question into Persian. Here's the step-by-step process and justification of my answer: 1. Identify the parts of the question: \\"What is the difference between statutory and non-statutory body?\\" The question is asking for a comparison or definition of two types of bodies: statutory and non-statutory. 2. Understand the terminology used in the question: - Statutory: Legal or given by statute (law). - Non-statutory: Not based on or created by law. 3. Translate the key terms into Persian: - Statutory: قانونی (qa'nooni) - Non-statutory: غیر قانونی (ghayr-qa'nooni) 4. Form the translated question in Persian, maintaining the original meaning and structure: \\"هوشیارانه تفاوت بین سازمان قانونی و سازمان غیر قانونی چیست؟\\" (Hovesiareh tumfayvid vaheen āzānān-e qa'noonieshooni va goy-e qa'noonieshooni chi-ast?) In Persian, the translated question is as follows: \\"What is the difference between a statutory body and a non-statutory body?\\", The question you provided is asking about the difference between \\"statutory\\" and \\"non-statutory\\" bodies. Here's how you can translate these terms into Persian: Statutory body: عضو قانونی (adhv-e ghanouni) or سازمان قانونی (sazeman-e ghanouni) Non-statutory body: عضو غیر قانونی (adhv-e gheyr-e ghanouni) or سازمان غیر قانونی (sazeman-e gheyr-e ghanouni) Now, let's explain the difference between these two terms: A statutory body is a type of organization that is created and governed by a specific law or statute. This means that its powers, duties, and structure are clearly defined and regulated by legislation. Examples of statutory bodies include government departments, regulatory agencies, and public authorities. On the other hand, a non-statutory body is an organization that is not created or governed by a specific law or statute. Instead, it may be established by a government department, a private organization, or a group of individuals. Non-statutory bodies typically have more flexibility in their operations and decision-making processes, as they are not subject to the same legal requirements and constraints as statutory bodies. However, they may also have less authority and legitimacy, as they are not explicitly created or recognized by law. Therefore, the key difference between statutory and non-statutory bodies lies in their legal status and regulatory framework. Statutory bodies are created and governed by law, while non-statutory bodies are not.,تفاوت بین سازمان قانونی و غیر قانونی چیست؟ I have translated the given question from English to Persian. In Persian, \\"What is the difference between statutory and non statutory body?\\" is represented by \\"تفاوت بین سازمان قانونی و غیر قانونی چیست؟\\".

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. The writer believes that - people should learn - people should isten - not enough information - people should take feedback Answer:","candidates_completions":"The writer suggests that it is crucial for individuals to understand the value of feedback and failure for personal growth. While many express the importance of these in theory, it can be difficult for people who possess high social standing or are insecure about their work. One must balance confidence in their abilities with self-awareness of their limitations in order to effectively learn from feedback. This blend of self-assurance, humility, and openness to feedback can help individuals improve upon their current skills and performances. Moreover, embracing failure clarifies that one's current difficulties can be temporary, and the drive to learn and improve offers hope for betterment and development., The author emphasizes the importance of learning from feedback and failure as a means of self-improvement, while acknowledging that it can be a challenging process for many people, regardless of their level of confidence. Here are some key takeaways from the text: 1. Embrace feedback and failure: While it may be difficult to accept criticism or deal with failure, these experiences can provide valuable lessons that help you grow and improve. 2. Cultivate a balance of confidence and self-awareness: Confidence in your abilities is essential, but being aware of your limitations allows you to identify areas where you can learn and grow. 3. Understand the temporary nature of failure: Remember that failure is not permanent; it's an opportunity to learn and improve, and eventually, you will succeed. 4. Be open to learning: Adopt a growth mindset and be willing to listen and learn from others, even if their feedback is challenging to accept. 5. Pay attention to the feedback you receive: Make sure you are actively listening and taking in the feedback you receive, rather than dismissing it outright. In summary, by maintaining a balanced perspective that combines confidence and self-awareness, you can more effectively learn from feedback and failure. This approach can help you grow as a professional and as an individual, allowing you to better navigate the challenges and opportunities that come your way.,Embracing failure and accepting critical feedback play a crucial role in personal and professional growth. The right balance between self-confidence and the awareness of one's limitations is essential to make the most out of such opportunities for self-improvement. Here's how feedback and failure can be turned into advantages: 1. Cultivate a growth mindset: A growth mindset emphasizes the belief that skills and abilities can be improved over time. By adopting this perspective, you will be more open to learning from your mistakes and using feedback as a catalyst for growth. 2. Practice active listening: When receiving feedback, listen carefully without being defensive. This will allow you to genuinely understand the other person's perspective and take their advice into account in your future work. 3. Reflect on your experiences: Take the time to ponder on feedback you've received or past failures. Analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan to address these shortcomings. 4. Focus on your strengths: Recognize your strengths and leverage them to overcome your weaknesses. By focusing on your strong points, you can develop the confidence needed to tackle your limitations and be more receptive to critical feedback. 5. Develop resilience: Understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process. By building resilience, you'll be able to bounce back more quickly from setbacks and maintain your motivation to keep learning and growing. 6. Foster a supportive and open environment: Encourage open communication within teams to promote the sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, and opportunities for learning. This will create a culture where feedback is not only welcome but actively sought after. 7. Manage your emotions: It's easy to feel hurt by negative feedback or failure. However, learning to manage your emotions and respond positively to such situations can help you stay focused on your goals and continue to grow. 8. Seek mentorship: Find experienced professionals who can provide guidance, support, and constructive criticism as you progress in your career. Their advice and feedback will be invaluable in helping you improve your skills and navigate challenges. By employing these techniques, you can make feedback and failure work to your advantage. Combining self-confidence with an understanding of your limitations creates a productive environment for learning and improvement, fostering personal and professional growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after.

After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea.

The narrator describes their routine of going up the lane together and spending time with each other, and how he would poach a couple of rainbow trouts for them to share as a meal afterwards. He mentions that Mitzi was very thin, and he felt that providing her with a good meal was the least he could do in return for her company and the moments they shared. The narrator's description of Mitzi and their time together reveals a great deal about their relationship and the circumstances surrounding it. It shows that, despite her being deaf and mute, Mitzi and the narrator shared a deep connection, one that was perhaps strengthened by their simple, shared experiences, such as enjoying a meal of trout by the trout farm. These memories, however, haunt the narrator as he keeps reflecting on that fateful day when something went wrong between them. The sun, in its daily appearance, constantly reminds him of what he has done and how he has failed Mitzi. No matter how hard he tries to escape and hide from the truth, it remains in his mind, tormenting him with the knowledge that if Mitzi were to come back, he could never truly make amends for the harm he has caused. The story of the narrator and Mitzi Barker is one of regret, guilt, and a longing for closure that may never come. It is a poignant reminder of the weight of our actions and how the choices we make can haunt us for years to come., The narrator and Mitzi Barker would eat poached trout that the narrator had caught from a local trout farm, after spending time together. This seems to be a memory from the past that the narrator cherishes, as it brings up details such as the scent of Mitzi's hair and the food they shared together. The trout symbolizes a simple pleasure and a connection between the two characters, amidst the challenges and harsh realities they faced in their lives.,The narrator and Mitzi would eat trout after their encounters, as a way for the narrator to provide some comfort and sustenance to Mitzi, considering her vulnerable situation.

Some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how \\"thought-provoking\\" and \\"slow-paced-without-action-because it's an intelligent film\\" it was.

Lame concept but the movie took the \\"sin-eater\\" thing too seriously, making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was. Yeah, I know there were really sin-eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy. Nothing in the movie was executed right and I forget why I even bothered to see this movie.

What Are Some Of The Biggest Red Flags In An Interviewee? This question originally appeared on Quora: What are some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee? Answer by Sarah Smith, VP of Recruiting/HR, on Quora I’ve had the fortune to interview hundreds of people (maybe over a thousand by now) in private education and technology and have found the following to be the biggest red flags in interviews: Victim Mentality To me as an interviewer, there is no bigger red flag than victim mentality. When I ask, “Tell me about your interest in this role,” and I get an answer along the lines of, “Well, I’m at Facebook/Google/Microsoft/<insert other larger company> and have really tapped out on what I can learn here. There’s no more room for me to grow,” you’ve pretty much lost me. Are you seriously trying to tell me that there are literally no more opportunities for learning at a 10-30-100 THOUSAND person company? If you cannot find anything to learn there, how are you going to do when you have to roll up your sleeves and do a fair bit of less glamorous work at a start-up? I’ve worked in some very mundane jobs earlier in my career and have never been “bored”. There is always something to learn. Similarly, I see a huge red flag when an applicant talks about their boss “hating” them or really anyone in the organization that is “against” them. Talk of being “limited” or “capped” are also words I associate with victim mentality. It’s certainly possible that you are at a company or team that is a sinking ship and you want to get out, but you can always find something to learn in all situations and paint your interest in a role in a positive, learning light. Lack of Product Knowledge or Passion I have little patience for candidates who have not used our product. It is the easiest, most straight-forward way to prepare for an interview. I’m baffled by candidates who have never used our product or say that they don’t use it much. You are about to spend likely 50%+ of your waking hours on this product. Shouldn’t you love it and be compelled by it? Take the time to read a few blog posts from the company. Use the product. Ask and answer a few questions. It will help you know if you want to actually work on it and will help you perform better and more knowledgeably in your interviews. As one other guidepost, I recommend thinking about preparing for an interview like you would prepare for a final exam. You should spend hours and hours reading and preparing. Whenever I’ve interviewed anywhere, I spent at least 10-20 hours researching before the first conversation. Show that you really want the opportunity! Arrogance Luckily, it’s rare for someone to make it too far in our process if they are arrogant but every once in awhile someone gets to onsite. If we hear of anyone treating anyone at our company poorly (receptionist, recruiting team, interviewers, custodial staff), that’s a huge red flag. If you come into an interview with a huge ego, it’s unlikely to go away when you’re working in a team with humble, nice people. Short Terms of Employment I don’t immediately reject applicants who have a shorter term at one company but I’d certainly want to know why. For example, if I saw an applicant at any pre or post-IPO tech company for less than a year or two, I’d ask why as I want to confirm whether they were involuntarily terminated. If so, then I’d want to understand more about the circumstances and whether the position we’re considering them for is likely a much better fit. Swearing Again, while I wouldn’t completely rule out a candidate for swearing in an interview, it would be a big red flag. To me, swearing in an interview shows very poor judgment and lack of self-awareness in the situation. Write a one or two sentence summary.","candidates_completions":"Some of the biggest red flags in interviewees are victim mentality, lacking product knowledge or passion, arrogance, short terms of employment, and swearing, as these traits often indicate poor judgment, a lack of self-awareness, or an inability to adapt to different situations., Some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee include a victim mentality, lack of product knowledge or passion, arrogance, and short terms of employment, as well as inappropriate language during the interview.

Your job is to translate the Spanish sentence into Hebrew. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Desde que Adichie habló hace siete años, ha habido un auge en la narración de cuentos. Student:","candidates_completions":"Sure, I understand the problem. The task is to translate a Spanish sentence to Hebrew. Here's how I would do it: The Spanish sentence \\"Desde que Adichie habló hace siete años, ha habido un auge en la narración de cuentos\\" can be broken down into its English translation first: \\"Since Adichie spoke seven years ago, there has been a boom in storytelling.\\" Now, I will translate the English sentence into Hebrew, keeping in mind that the sentence structure in Hebrew is different from that in English or Spanish. The word order in Hebrew is often subject-object-verb (SOV) rather than subject-verb-object (SVO) as in English and Spanish. Additionally, Hebrew has a system of grammatical gender and verb conjugation to reflect gender, which is different from Spanish. Here is the English sentence \\"Since Adichie spoke seven years ago, there has been a boom in storytelling\\" translated to Hebrew: מאז דברה אדיחי לפני שבע שנים, היתה התפתחות עיקרית בסיפורים. The first part of the sentence, \\"Since Adichie spoke seven years ago,\\" can be translated as \\"מאז דברה אדיחי לפני שבע שנים\\" (mizad baira Adichie lefani sheva shanim). Here, \\"mizad\\" means \\"since,\\" \\"baira\\" means \\"spoke,\\" \\"Adichie\\" is a proper name and stays the same, and \\"lefani sheva shanim\\" means \\"seven years ago.\\" The second part of the sentence, \\"there has been a boom in storytelling,\\" can be translated as \\"היתה התפתחות עיקרית בסיפורים\\" (hitah hitpatechut ekarit besipurim). Here, \\"hitah\\" means \\"there has been,\\" \\"hitpatechut\\" means \\"boom\\" or \\"development,\\" and \\"esipurim\\" means \\"storytelling.\\" So, the Hebrew translation of the Spanish sentence \\"Desde que Adichie habló hace siete años, ha habido un auge en la narración de cuentos\\" is \\"מאז דברה אדיחי לפני שבע שנים, היתה התפתחות עיקרית בסיפורים\\" (mizad baira Adichie lefani sheva shanim, hitah hitpatechut ekarit besipurim).,Student: Yes, I understand the problem. I have to translate the given Spanish sentence into Hebrew. Step 1: Identify the key words and phrases in the sentence: \\"Desde que Adichie habló hace siete años, ha habido un auge en la narración de cuentos.\\" Step 2: Find the corresponding Hebrew translations for each key word and phrase: Desde que = מאז (me'az) Adichie (proper noun, remains the same) = אדישי (Adichie) habló = דיברה (dibra) hace siete años = לפני שבע שנים (lifnei sheva shanim) ha habido = היה (haya) un auge = עליה (aliya) en la narración = בסיפור (besipur) de cuentos = של סיפורים (shel sipurim) Step 3: Put the translated words together to form a coherent sentence in Hebrew: \\"מאז אדישי דיברה לפני שבע שנים, היה עליה בסיפור של סיפורים.\\" Translation of \\"Desde que Adichie habló hace siete años, ha habido un auge en la narración de cuentos.\\" in Hebrew is: \\"מאז אדישי דיברה לפני שבע שנים, היה עליה בסיפור של סיפורים.\\",כעת בבקשה, תהיה מבוססת על אמצעי הדעת ותקשר את המשפט הסיני הזה לעברית לה: מאז שאידיכש 'דיברה לפני שבע שנים, היה יום ראשון בגידול בסיפור סיפורים."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited. - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II.

Charlie decides to run for student council president as a method to genuinely help the student body—promising to work on improving academic performance, introducing more extracurricular opportunities, and making the school a more inclusive environment. The turning point in the election occurs when Charlie and his diverse, quirky team proposes a bold initiative - to restore the beloved old-school bell located on school grounds, which has been neglected for years.

The bell restoration project turns out to be a challenging adventure for Charlie's team, particularly when they stumble upon a hidden cache beneath the bell, bringing into play a mysterious past that knits them to their school’s heritage. Meanwhile, Ethan, alarmed by the popularity of Charlie's campaign, devises increasingly elaborate, but unsuccessful, schemes to sabotage him. His competitive obsession with winning exploits the weaknesses of his own team, which is more interested in using their positions for personal fame and power. As the students begin to recognize the authenticity in Charlie's campaign, Ethan's character fractures, leading him down a path of progressively poor strategies, including an attempted smear campaign against Charlie.

The wine list was also thoughtfully curated, featuring a mix of both well-known classics and delightful lesser-known gems. For our meal, I ordered the seared scallops with a delicate cauliflower purée to start, while my partner opted for the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Both appetizers were visually stunning and bursting with flavor. The scallops were cooked to perfection – tender, juicy, and expertly balanced by the creamy cauliflower purée. The beet salad was equally impressive, with the sweetness of the beets and tangy goat cheese marrying together in perfect harmony. Our main courses were equally exquisite. I chose the succulent slow-roasted lamb shank with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed asparagus, while my partner decided on the pan-seared salmon with vegetable quinoa and a zesty lemon-dill sauce. The love and care poured into crafting these dishes was evident in every bite. The lamb practically fell off the bone and the flavor was enhanced beautifully by a rich, velvety sauce. The salmon was cooked to perfection, moist and flaky, while the lemon-dill sauce provided a refreshing, tangy finish. As if our taste buds hadn't been pampered enough, the dessert menu beckoned us in for one final hurrah. I simply couldn't resist the triple chocolate mousse, and my partner selected the raspberry panna cotta. Heavenly is the only word that comes close to describing the decadence of the chocolate mousse – it was unbelievably smooth, with layers of intense and varied chocolate flavors that danced on my tongue. The raspberry panna cotta was artistically presented and radiated a perfect balance of tart and sweet. Throughout our meal, the service remained impeccable. Our server consistently checked on us without being intrusive, ensuring our wine glasses were filled, and promptly attending to any requests. It is clear that the staff at Enchanted Garden Bistro are well-trained and passionate about providing an exceptional experience for their patrons. I wholeheartedly recommend the Enchanted Garden Bistro for anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary adventure. The sublime food, impeccable service, and enchanting atmosphere all come together to create a dining experience that is truly a cut above the rest. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to this magical place.,Title: A Delightful Dining Experience - A Home Away from Home Review: I had the pleasure of dining at this wonderful establishment last weekend, and I must say it truly was an experience to remember! I chose option (2) - a positive review - because our visit exceeded all expectations, and I believe it is genuinely deserving of high praises. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the warm ambiance and welcoming staff made us feel instantly at home. The decor was tasteful and eclectic, with vintage pieces and distinctive artwork scattered throughout the space - it provided a unique charm that set the mood for the evening. We were greeted by a friendly host who quickly showed us to our table, which was one of several cozy nooks throughout the restaurant. The seating areas are thoughtfully constructed to ensure each guest's privacy, creating an intimate atmosphere where couples or small groups can enjoy each other's company without distractions. We started by sampling an array of appetizers, each one more delicious than the last. The menu boasted a delightful variety of options, with selections that catered to different dietary preferences and tastebuds. The chef clearly takes great pride in using fresh, locally sourced ingredients and presented the dishes with exceptional attention to detail. For my entrée, I ordered the fish of the day with seasonal vegetables, and it was cooked to perfection! The fish was flaky, tender, and had a subtle, yet delectable flavor that paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces. I must say, I have not tasted fish this succulent in a long time. The seasonal vegetables were equally enjoyable and crisp, with flavors that complemented the main dish well. My partner opted for the restaurant's signature dish, a rib-eye steak, which came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint! The steak was cooked exactly as specified (medium rare), and the presentation was simply superb. All carnivores in the room couldn't help but feel envious when it was placed before him. Moving on to dessert, the chocolate lava cake stole the show! As an avid chocolate lover, I was impressed by the balance they achieved between the warm, gooey center and the slightly crisp outer layer. The accompanying vanilla ice cream provided the perfect finishing touch, leaving us feeling incredibly satisfied. The service throughout our meal was impeccable. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and always available to answer questions or provide recommendations. She provided a constant flow of water without being intrusive and refilled our napkins after each use, which I found to be a thoughtful and appreciated gesture. The ambiance, exquisite food, and outstanding service all culminated in a truly memorable dining experience. I highly recommend making a trip to this fantastic establishment, and I promise it will leave you craving a return visit. On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this restaurant a well-deserved 5-star rating - and I look forward to my next visit!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride. Donations were flooding in last night for a cyclist who was killed by a suspected drink driver during a 24-hour charity ride. Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by the car. The married father of three was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday. Mr Smith was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind. But by 1.30pm yesterday £1,455 had been donated by 50 people. And as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website. Just two hours later the total had soared to £13,533 from 860 people. Further gifts continued to roll in from generous members of the public, with the total reaching £20,000 before 6pm and £30,000 by 8.30pm. One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’ Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home. An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26. On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems. Donations: Friends have given thousands of pounds to charity in Mr Smith's memory. He wrote: ‘I have had my own. misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was. unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the. future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been. fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends. ‘There. are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support. and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’ Mr. Smith, from Boughton Aluph, Kent, planned to celebrate completing the. challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have. turned 39 tomorrow. On his. online LinkedIn business profile he said he had worked as an operations. manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a. new challenge’. His family. said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of. Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves. a loving wife and three children.’ Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith. ‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’ PC. Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation. Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot. travelling along the road prior to the collision.’ The. public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire.

Information: - Ted Skjellum (born 4 March 1972), also known by the stage names Nocturno Culto, Nocturno or Kveldulv, is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist, lead guitarist, and partial bassist (shared with Fenriz) of the influential black metal band Darkthrone. He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet. - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\") are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes. - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","candidates_completions":"A. Intensive surveillance and monitoring B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns C. Quarantine protocols D. Antiviral medications The correct answer to the question is B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns. Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, was a highly contagious and deadly disease with a mortality rate of around 30%. In the past, it affected millions of individuals worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) certified the eradication of smallpox in 1980, marking it as the first disease to be eradicated by human effort, and this success is primarily due to the widespread use of smallpox vaccination campaigns. Vaccination campaigns against smallpox were instrumental in preventing the spread of the disease and eventually leading to its eradication. These campaigns used the smallpox vaccine, which contains a live virus known as vaccinia, which is closely related to the variola virus. Once an individual receives the vaccine, their immune system develops a response that protects them against smallpox, creating herd immunity that prevents the spread of the disease within communities. Edward Jenner, an English physician, is credited with the discovery of the smallpox vaccine (smallpox and cowpox material) in 1796. By the early 20th century, several countries implemented mandatory smallpox vaccination programs, which were later expanded to other countries with the support of international organizations. In 1967, the WHO initiated an Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program that aimed to eradicate smallpox globally by utilizing vaccination campaigns. The program involved surveillance and containment strategies, in addition to mass vaccination of entire populations in affected areas. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977, and after careful examination and investigations, WHO declared the eradication of smallpox in 1980. While other measures like intensive surveillance, monitoring, quarantine protocols, and antiviral medications also have a role in controlling infectious diseases, it is the smallpox vaccination campaigns that were the most responsible for preventing future pandemics of smallpox. Although smallpox no longer exists in the natural environment, efforts are being made to maintain high biosafety procedures in laboratories possessing variola virus stocks to ensure that the virus is not accidentally released. The success of the smallpox vaccination campaigns is a testament to the power of vaccines and serves as a motivating example for the eradication of other infectious diseases, such as polio and Guinea worm disease., The correct answer to the question is Vaccination. Smallpox is a highly contagious and deadly virus that was responsible for millions of deaths worldwide before it was declared eradicated in 1980. This momentous achievement was made possible through an unprecedented global vaccination campaign led by the World Health Organization (WHO). The smallpox vaccine is made from a weakened form of the virus, which stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that protect against the disease. The vaccine is highly effective, providing immunity in 95% of those who receive it. Since the eradication of smallpox, vaccination campaigns have been halted, and the virus is now only kept in two secure laboratories in the world. However, the threat of smallpox as a biological weapon means that the vaccine remains an essential tool for preventing future pandemics of this deadly disease. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, vaccination would be the primary means of controlling the spread of the virus. Healthcare workers, emergency responders, and military personnel are often vaccinated as a precautionary measure, and stockpiles of the vaccine are maintained by governments and international organizations. In summary, vaccination is the tool most responsible for preventing future pandemics of smallpox. The global eradication of smallpox through vaccination is a testament to the power of this public health intervention, and it remains an essential tool for protecting against this deadly disease.,The correct answer to the question regarding the tool most responsible for preventing future pandemics of smallpox is: Smallpox vaccination. Smallpox vaccination is the primary tool that has been responsible for the eradication of smallpox, which significantly reduced cases and prevented future pandemics of the disease. In the mid-20th century, the World Health Organization launched a global vaccination campaign that successfully eradicated smallpox by 1980. Before the vaccine's widespread use, smallpox was a devastating disease, claiming an estimated 300 to 500 million lives in the 20th century alone. The smallpox vaccine, which usually takes the form of a live, attenuated (weakened) virus known as vaccinia, creates immunity in patients, protecting them from contracting smallpox when exposed to the virus. In recent years, the smallpox vaccine has receded into the background since the disease has not been present in human populations. However, in the face of a potential bioterrorist threat involving smallpox, many countries hold stockpiles of smallpox vaccines to have enough ready in case of a large-scale outbreak. This suggests that the smallpox vaccine remains an essential tool in global health preparedness initiatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

He says that \\"pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants\\" and \\"bees also collect pollen\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","candidates_completions":"The bee's pollen sacs collects something that consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. Here are the step-by-step reasoning: 1. I am given a quiz question and I need to find the answer. In this case \\"What collects something that consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants\\". 2. The teacher provides a hint which states \\"pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants\\", which immediately identifies that the object we're looking for is pollen. 3. The other hint from the teacher is \\"bees also collect pollen\\". Thus, we can deduce that the bee's pollen sacs collect the target object. 4. The target object, pollen, consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. 5. Therefore, the answer to the question is the bee's pollen sacs that collect pollen.,The best answer to the question is: bees. Step 1: Understand the quiz question - In this case, we are asked to find what collects something that consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. Step 2: Analyze teacher's hint - Our teacher gives us two hints: (1) Pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants, and (2) Bees also collect pollen. Step 3: Match the hints to the quiz question - The first hint gives us information about the tiny grains in the question, which are the pollen. The second hint tells us who collects these grains, which are bees. Step 4: Conclude the answer - Since the question asks for what collects these tiny male gamete grains (pollen), and the hint given by the teacher states that bees collect pollen, the best answer is bees., The best answer to the quiz question would be \\"pollen.\\" Here's the step-by-step thought process: 1. The quiz question asks for something that consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. 2. The teacher provides a hint that \\"pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants.\\" This directly relates to the question asked. 3. The teacher also mentions that \\"bees collect pollen.\\" This suggests that pollen is a substance that can be collected and is related to plants, further supporting the idea that pollen is the correct answer. 4. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the best answer to the quiz question is \\"pollen\\" since it fits the criteria given in the question and is supported by the teacher's hints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Feeling tired lately? Has a doctor said he can't find anything wrong with you? Perhaps he sent you to a hospital, but all the advanced equipment there shows that there is nothing wrong with you. Then, consider this: you might be in a state of subhealth. Subhealth, also called the third state or gray state, is explained as a borderline state between health and disease. According to the study by the National Health Organization, over 45 percent of subhealthy people are middle-aged or elderly. The percentage is even higher among people who work in management position as well as students around exam time. Symptoms include a lack of energy, depression, slow reactions, sleeplessness, anxiety, and poor memory. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating and aching in the waist and legs. The key to preventing and recovering from subhealth, according to some medical experts, is to form good living habits, alternately work with rest, exercise regularly, and take part in open air activities. As for meals, people are advised to eat less salt and sugar. They should eat more fresh vegetables, fruits and fish because they are rich in nutritional elements-vitamins and trace elements that are important to the body. Nutrition experts point out that it is not good to eat too much at one meal because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract . They also say that a balanced diet is very helpful in avoiding subhealth. Question: According to this passage, which of the following is right? Options: A: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should be sent to a hospital. B: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should buy some medicine and quit your job. C: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should find out the reasons and relax yourself. D: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should have yourself examined in foreign countries. Answer:","candidates_completions":"C: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should find out the reasons and relax yourself., C: When you are in a state of subhealth, you should find out the reasons and relax yourself.

Question 1: Which is the best shampoo for Dandruff? Question 2: What are the best shampoos for dandruff? OPT: (A). no; (B). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","candidates_completions":"Both questions are related, but they are not asking the same thing. Let me explain why and discuss each question step-by-step. Question 1: \\"Which is the best shampoo for Dandruff?\\" This question is asking for a specific recommendation for the single best shampoo for dandruff. To find the best shampoo for dandruff, I will consider factors such as ingredients, effectiveness, and customer reviews. However, the question assumes that there only exists a single \\"best\\" shampoo, which might not be accurate as different people may have different preferences or hair types. Step 1: Research the potential ingredients that can combat dandruff (e.g., salicylic acid, ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione). Step 2: Look for shampoos containing these ingredients. Step 3: Read reviews and consider any side effects. Step 4: Provide a list of recommended shampoos. Question 2: \\"What are the best shampoos for dandruff?\\" This question is inquiring about multiple shampoos that are effective at treating dandruff. It acknowledges that there may not be just one best shampoo but rather a few good options. Step 1: Research common dandruff-fighting ingredients, such as salicylic acid, ketoconazole, and zinc pyrithione. Step 2: Gather a list of shampoos containing these ingredients. Step 3: Compare the different shampoos based on factors like customer reviews, price, and other factors. Step 4: Present a categorized list of top recommended shampoos. Now let's respond to the original OPT: (A). no; (B). yes. The correct answer is (A). no. The two questions are related but not asking the same thing. While Question 1 seeks a singular best shampoo, Question 2 inquires about various good options.,Step 1: Understand the context of both questions. Both questions are related to finding the best shampoo for dandruff. Step 2: Analyze the differences between the two questions. Question 1 asks for the single best shampoo for dandruff, while Question 2 asks for a list of the best shampoos for dandruff. Step 3: Compare the differences and the overall goal. In comparing these two questions, we can see the difference lies in the scope of the answer: a single shampoo versus multiple shampoos. However, the overall goal is to find the best shampoo or shampoos for treating dandruff. Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the comparison. Based on the comparison, both questions primarily aim to find the best solution(s) for dandruff in the form of shampoo. Answer: Based on the analysis, the answer is (B) yes, as both questions are fundamentally asking about the best shampoo(s) for dandruff, despite the difference in the scope of the answer., (A). no, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Justification: Question 1 asks for \\"the best\\" shampoo for dandruff, implying that there is a single, superior option. In contrast, question 2 asks for \\"the best shampoos\\" for dandruff, which suggests that multiple products could be recommended. Step-by-step answer for question 1: 1. Investigate different shampoo brands and their ingredients. 2. Shortlist shampoos that contain active ingredients known to combat dandruff, such as zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, coal tar, salicylic acid, or ketoconazole. 3. Research customer reviews and expert opinions to determine overall effectiveness, ease of use, and potential side effects. 4. Based on the collected data, select the shampoo with the highest combined rating for effectiveness and user satisfaction. Unfortunately, since I cannot browse the internet or access real-time customer feedback, I cannot provide the name of the 'best' shampoo for dandruff. Step-by-step answer for question 2: 1. Gather a list of shampoo brands that contain active ingredients to combat dandruff. 2. Classify these shampoos based on their primary active ingredients. 3. Research customer reviews and expert opinions for each shampoo to determine individual effectiveness, ease of use, and potential side effects. 4. Once data is collected, list the shampoos with high combined ratings for effectiveness, user satisfaction, and value in each category. Again, without access to real-time data, I cannot provide the 'best' shampoos for dandruff. However, examples could include shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, coal tar, salicylic acid, and ketoconazole. Users should choose a shampoo based on personal preference, scalp and hair type, and tolerance to side effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. 2007 FIBA Americas Championship For 10 mens national basketball programs representing countries in the Americas, the road to the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing runs through Las Vegas. The 2007 FIBA Americas Championships are set to go from Aug. 22  Sept. 2 and for a retooled team from Canada, the stakes couldnt be higher with Olympic berths on the line. \\"I think the team is very focused,\\" said head coach Leo Rautins in a recent phone interview from San Juan, Puerto Rico in preparation for the tune-up Tuto Marchand Cup. \\"They understand that it's a tough task at hand, but at the same time they realize it has to be all of them doing it together, all 12 guys. But the effort and concentration has been there.\\" Rautins is banking on a young team to bring Canada back to its first Olympic basketball appearance since 2000, where the team was lead by Steve Nash and ultimately finished seventh. Now, a new generation of players with ranging NBA experience will lead the team, including guards Carl English and Denham Brown, forwards Juan Mendez, Olu Famutimi and Levon Kendall as well as centre Samuel Dalembert. Rautins is currently using the four-team exhibition tournament in order to establish those younger players in game situations and nail down his best lineups. \\"We have such limited opportunity to give these guys experience that the plan was to just do whatever we can to load them up with whatever we could give them and hopefully this year, next year and the year after really starts to pay dividends,\\" he says. In order to even think about next summer however, Canada will need a strong showing in Las Vegas. Teams that reach the finals at the FIBA Americas automatically get their ticket punched for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. But the third, fourth and fifth place finishers will have another chance in a tougher World Olympic Qualifying tournament taking place a month before the Games and featuring similar finishers from FIBA Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania tournaments being played in the next month. Rautins is understandably dreaming big (\\"just like everyone else we're shooting for those top two spots,\\" he says), but even he knows that his team will need to fight through some deficiencies to earn a chance to qualify in 2008. \\"This group has to take advantage of its skills but I think we also have to cover up a few things,\\" says Rautins. \\"We're not particularly strong at point guard and that's something that we've adjusted in how we play. We're kind of playing that position by committee and we've adjusted how we run and how we get into our offence accordingly.\\" Of course, Canada does happen to have a pretty good point guard in Nash, who hasnt ruled out Beijing in 2008 should Canada qualify, but passed on Vegas this summer. \\"Nash doesn't need to make excuses, he's put in many years with this team,\\" says Rautins. \\"He certainly has left the door open for next year, if we're successful in getting there. With his personality and what he's done, the guys are open and willing to have him come in, even though he might not be there right now.\\" Fellow NBA player Jamaal Magloire once again has declined the invitation to represent Canada in international play, but Rautins says both cases clearly can't be considered in the same context. \\"I've repeatedly tried to communicate with Magloire and my last communication was that we were supposed to have a sit-down to talk about it and he never followed through on that,\\" he says. \\"Then, I pick up the newspaper and he indicates that he won't be playing but he's looking forward to joining the team if we qualify. \\"Quite honestly, a lot of this team saw that and they weren't too impressed by that and you know, nor was I. \\"He's a big guy, he's an NBA talent and I wouldn't want to hurt these guys by not having him there. But if they don't feel he belongs there then he won't be there, regardless of what his intentions are.\\" Magloire's skills as a centre might have become easier to live without thanks to the recent addition of Philadelphia 76'ers centre Dalembert to the Canadian team. The Montreal resident, by way of Haiti, was sworn in as a Canadian citizen on Aug. 7, and should provide a true anchor in the post for his newly adopted home country despite his limited international experience. \\"He can run, he can play above the rim and he's a tremendous shot blocker so he's going to present problems for opposing bigs and our job is just to put him in situations where he can catch it on the move and take advantage of people around the basket,\\" says Rautins, who also is cautioning patience with his starting centre given that he's only had two weeks to get ready. \\"He was doing what he can along with other things to potentially prepare but certainly, he's not in mid-season form, so it's going to be interesting to see the adjustment.\\" A strong contribution from Dalembert in Las Vegas could provide a huge boost to a nation desperate to get back Olympic competition but his coach knows that it's going to take more than just the efforts of one player in order for Canada to advance. \\"We have to have some players really step up and play as good as they can play,\\" says Rautins. \\"We need every single player on the same page, not one guy can stray or vary from that and we have to have absolute effort on the defensive end of the floor at all times.\\" The rest of the field Even at its best however, Canada will face a daunting challenge in a tournament that became much more competitive thanks to a result from over a year ago. On Sept. 1, 2006, both the United States and Argentina were dumped from the semi-finals of the 2006 World Championships, allowing Spain to prevail and earn a guaranteed spot in Beijing in the process. So instead of the world No.1 Americans or the defending Olympic champion Argentines treating this trip to the Strip like a working vacation, these basketball superpowers are going to have to go all-out at the University Nevada-Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Centre. That may be bad news for the rest of the field, but it definitely ups the international intrigue for basketball fans looking for a late-summer fix. Sports Online breaks down the rest of the field for the 2007 FIBA Basketball Americas tournament. The Favourite  United States With all due respect to the defending champs from Argentina, nobody should be betting against the house in this tournament. The U.S. appears poised, reloaded and refocused after its debacle in Athens in 2004, which saw them fail to clinch Olympic gold for the first time since the pre-Dream Team days. That team was led by Tim Duncan and backed by a flock of the NBAs brightest young stars but was exposed against international defensive zones and fizzled to a bronze-medal finish under head coach Larry Brown. But incoming managing director Jerry Colangelo and a revamped coaching staff led by Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski appear to have worked hard on addressing their weaknesses. While a large degree of improvement can be expected from the development of players like Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh, the real difference with this team is the addition of shooters and stability in the backcourt that cost them dearly in 2004. Player to watch: On a team littered with all-world talent barely old enough to enjoy an adult beverage in Las Vegas, the U.S. team should clinch a top-two finish if it can get the best out of the 34-year-old New Jersey Nets floor general Jason Kidd. No other NBA player outside of Steve Nash can elevate the play of his teammates like Kidd. The Olympic gold medalist's ability to run the fast break and pick apart half-court zone defences solves a lot of the issues this team had in Athens. A walking triple-double any time he steps on the floor, Kidd is showing no signs of slowing down as hes coming off one of his finest seasons. The Defending Champs  Argentina Argentina would normally be a lock with the US to advance from this tournament but whos missing from the defending Olympic champs heading into Las Vegas has become just as much of a story as whos going. Missing in action will be current NBA players Manu Ginobili (San Antonio Spurs), Fabricio Oberto (Spurs), Walter Hermann (Charlotte Bobcats) and former NBA point guard Pepe Sanchez. That leaves the bulk of the heavy lifting to guard Carlos Delfino (Toronto Raptors), power forward Luis Scola (Houston Rockets) and small forward Andres Nocioni (Chicago Bulls). Despite the absence of some its best, expect Argentina to still be a handful. Strong team play and an up-tempo style have made the defending Olympic gold medalists one of the strongest international squads on the planet. Player to watch: A versatile swingman, who was shrewdly acquired by Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo this off-season, Delfino will be required to pick up the scoring and leadership slack in the absence of the dynamic Ginobili. So far, he appears more than capable. At the tune-up Super 4 tournament in Santa Fe, Delfino scored 23 points in the championship game for the Argentines on his way to tournament MVP honours. Perhaps the most underrated team in the tournament, the Brazilians have put together a talented squad that could pull off an upset a team and finish with a guaranteed Olympic berth. Leandro Barbosa of the Phoenix Suns will serve as point guard and the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year will be joined by some talented big men including Spurs first-round pick Tiago Splitter, Anderson Varejao (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Nene (Denver Nuggets). Player to watch: A pretty serious knee blowout in the first game of the 2005 NBA campaign cost Nene well over a season. But he came back in the first half of the 2006 campaign to average 12 points and seven rebounds for Denver during the regular season and upped those numbers in the playoffs. His combined experience with the nuances of the international game as well the talent of the NBA should make him invaluable to Brazils chances. Should contend for the top five and seems to thrive in playing the role of giant killer. A lack of NBA-level talent didnt stop Puerto Rico from thumping the Americans 92-74 at Athens in 2004  handing the U.S. its first Olympic defeat with professionals on its roster and its most lopsided loss against top-flight international competition ever. Puerto Rico has traditionally shown no fear against the bigger kids on the playground and shouldnt be a pushover this time around either. Player to watch: Carlos Arroyos a journeyman in the NBA but nothing short of a warrior when he dons his national team jersey. The 28-year-old former Raptor and current Orlando Magic point guard is now a seasoned veteran for the national team having enjoyed his greatest success at last years World Championships where he averaged 21.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game from that tournament in Brazil. Playing the U.S., in particular, brings out the best in Arroyo.

Dubrovnik's cultural heritage is further enriched by its vibrant arts scene. The city is home to several museums, galleries, and theaters, showcasing a range of artistic and cultural exhibitions. The Dubrovnik Summer Festival, an annual cultural event held in July and August, is a major attraction for both locals and tourists alike. The festival features concerts, theater performances, and art exhibitions, highlighting the city's cultural diversity and creativity. Moreover, Dubrovnik's cultural significance is not limited to its artistic and historical heritage. The city is also known for its rich culinary tradition, with its cuisine heavily influenced by its proximity to the sea. Fresh seafood, homemade pasta, and locally produced wines are some of the city's most famous culinary delights.

Old Town Dubrovnik, with its century's old fortifications, cobblestone streets, and cascading rooftops, stands as a testament to the grandeur of the Croatian people's history and cultural traditions. The UNESCO label highlights Dubrovnik's exceptional value and unique architectural heritage, which represents an epitome of the European medieval city. Small pedestrian streets, stone alleys wound with stairs, and the external architectural articulation of the walls all attest to the character of this remarkable city. Facing the Adriatic Sea, the city has traditionally been a prosperous seaport, known for its thriving economy dating back to the 13th century. This maritime tradition has engendered some stunning architectures related to maritime activities. The Rector's Palace, once the administrative seat of the independent Republic of Ragusa (as Dubrovnik was formerly known), and the Sponza Palace are among the finest examples of such remarkable edifices. Furthermore, the city's wall has been no less important. This fortification wall has not only ensured the city's peace for centuries, but also left Dubrovnik as the best preserved fortified medieval town in the Mediterranean. It is often said that \\"only from the walls one can understand how was the genius of the city,” truly expressing admiration towards the architectural skill and civic mentality of the Dubrovnik's city planners. The city's churches are another significant cultural indication of its historical significance. St. Blaise's Church is one of the most distinguished religious structures in the city, named after the patron saint of Dubrovnik. It represents a prominent example of a late Gothic architecture and sculpture ensemble in the region. The Rectors’ Palace Treasury houses the famous sculptural works of the wings of the silver and gold Late Gothic shrine of St Blaise, which are one-of-a-kind artistic expressions reflecting the opulent style of the time. Moreover, the Dubrovnik Summer Festival, embracing theater, music, dance, and literature events, is held every year from June 30 to August 25. Since 1950 when it was first established, it has been a key cultural event in Croatia and significantly contributes to the preservation of Dubrovnik's artistic life and heritage. The festival's epicenter is usually Stradun Street and the old city walls, where most performances are held, reflecting the city's historical and cultural context. In conclusion, Dubrovnik, as a proud port city, is not only renowned for its marine adventures, but also recognized profoundly for its historical cultural values. Its marvelous and well-preserved architecture and vibrant cultural events attract an enormously large number of tourists, effectively making the city's identity inseparable from Croatia. This recognition as a cradle of Croatian culture and a World Heritage Site since 1979 shows the city's gradual evolution chronologically and architecturally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Later on, the emancipation reform of 1861 abolished serfdom, which further undermined the power of the nobility. In the early 20th century, the Russian Revolution led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Russian Empire and the privileges of the nobility. For the Kingdom of Prussia, the privileges of the nobility were gradually eroded during the 19th century as the kingdom underwent industrialization and modernization. The rise of liberal and democratic movements also led to the expansion of political rights and representation, which weakened the power of the nobility. In the 20th century, the Weimar Republic and the subsequent Nazi regime further eroded the privileges of the nobility. For the Habsburg Monarchy, the privileges of the nobility were also gradually eroded during the 19th century. The Austrian constitution of 1867, which established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, granted greater political rights and representation to non-noble elements of society. The end of World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 marked the end of the Habsburg Monarchy and the privileges of the nobility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Writer Matt Selman's involvement in \\"The Simpsons\\" led viewers to understand how the show began in the episode titled \\"Behind the Laughter,\\" which is a play on words of what VH1 series it is parodied after? A:","candidates_completions":"Sure, I'd be happy to help break down this question and provide a reasonable answer. The question consists of two main parts: 1. The involvement of Matt Selman in \\"The Simpsons.\\" 2. The connection of the episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" to a VH1 series. First, Matt Selman is a writer and producer for \\"The Simpsons.\\" He has been a part of the show's writing team since the late 1990s and has contributed to many memorable episodes. Second, the episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" is a parody of VH1's \\"Behind the Music,\\" a documentary series that explores the stories and histories of famous musicians and bands. In the Simpsons version, the episode uses a similar format to tell the story of the Simpson family, as if they were a real-life musical group with a dramatic behind-the-scenes narrative. The connection between Matt Selman and the episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" may not be directly related, as there's no clear indication that Selman played a significant role in the creation or development of this specific episode. However, as a writer for the show, Selman would have certainly been involved in the process of brainstorming, writing, and revising episodes throughout the series, including \\"Behind the Laughter.\\" So, while Selman didn't specifically create the episode as a parody of \\"Behind the Music,\\" his general involvement in the show most likely contributed to the final product.,To answer this complex question, I will analyze and reason about the input step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the main components of the question - The main components of the question are: Matt Selman, \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Behind the Laughter\\", play on words, and VH1 series. Step 2: Understand the context - Matt Selman is a writer and producer for \\"The Simpsons\\", a long-running animated series. - \\"Behind the Laughter\\" is an episode of \\"The Simpsons\\" that reveals how the show started. - This episode is a parody of a VH1 series and has a title that is a play on words of that series' title. Step 3: Identify the relationship between the components - Since \\"Behind the Laughter\\" is a parody and a play on words of the VH1 series' title, I need to find a VH1 series that has a similar-sounding title. Step 4: Find the VH1 series with a similar title - \\"Behind the Music\\" is a documentary series on VH1 that tells the story of various musicians and their careers. This title has a similar structure and sound to \\"Behind the Laughter.\\" Step 5: Answer the question - The \\"Behind the Laughter\\" episode of \\"The Simpsons\\" is a play on words of the VH1 series titled \\"Behind the Music,\\" which it is parodied after.,To answer this question, I need to identify the key elements in it. 1. Matt Selman's involvement with \\"The Simpsons\\" 2. The episode titled \\"Behind the Laughter\\" 3. The VH1 series it is parodying Step 1: Understanding Matt Selman's involvement with \\"The Simpsons\\" Matt Selman is an American television writer and producer known for his work on \\"The Simpsons.\\" Step 2: Analyzing the episode titled \\"Behind the Laughter\\" The episode titled \\"Behind the Laughter\\" is a parody of factual documentaries. It was broadcast in the 11th season of \\"The Simpsons\\" and promoted as an inside look into the lives of the show's fictional family. Step 3: Determining the VH1 series \\"Behind the Music\\" The VH1 series that \\"Behind the Laughter\\" parodies is \\"Behind the Music.\\" This documentary series provided an in-depth view of the lives and careers of popular music artists.

Castle, shot in the chest and blown off a pier in an explosion set by Glass, survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman, Candelaria. Once recovered, Castle goes to Tampa and takes refuge in an old tenement where three young outcasts â Dave, Bumpo, and Joan â live. Castle abducts Duka, who fearfully gives up information about the Saints â whom he, too, hates, and so willingly becomes Castle's mole.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: 6 Killer Google Chrome Extensions for Social Media Addicts About a year ago, Google launched Chrome, their super fast, open source web browser. Since then it has grabbed just over three and a half percent of the world’s web browser market, according to Net Applications. That’s not bad, but still puts Chrome firmly in fourth place behind Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. One of the reasons why Chrome has been stuck in fourth place: extensions — Chrome hasn’t got them. Or more precisely, ChromeChrome doesn’t have them yet. At least, not officially. If you ask most FirefoxFirefox fans the main reason they won’t switch to Chrome, a good majority of them will probably cite its lack of extensions. But that might change, because Chrome extensions are coming — perhaps soon. And for users of the developer’s build of Chrome, they’re already here. So for those of you brave enough to use the unstable developers release of Chrome, here are 6 extensions that social media addicts will want to install. Chrome only has extensions enabled in the developer release. To get that release, you have to subscribe to the Chrome Dev Channel. Once you’ve downloaded the developer’s version of the browser, you can begin to install extensions. For now, the best place to find and install extensions is probably from the ChromeExtensions.org directory, which offers one-click installation of extensions from its categorized listing. You can also find extensions via the ChromePlugins.org and GoogleChromePlugins.com forum communities, and via the My Chrome Addons blog. However, GoogleGoogle has recently dropped hints that an official extensions gallery may be coming soon, which also indicates that support for extensions in the stable release of Chrome might be right around the corner. Once you’ve installed some extensions, you can manage them by navigating to chrome://extensions in the address bar or clicking on ‘Extensions’ in the tools menu. Chrome extensions are still a very new animal, and Chrome’s developer build changes frequently, so be prepared for the extensions listed below to break on occasion. Staying up-to-date with email is one of the most important tasks for social media fanatics, and Chrome makes that task easier for GmailGmail users with the Gmail Checker extension. It’s one of Google’s official sample extensions and adds an indicator icon next to the address bar in Chrome that shows you how many unread messages you have in Gmail. The extension only works if you’re logged into Gmail, but that’s nice because it means you don’t actually have to share your password with any third-party. There are a bunch of TwitterTwitter extensions for Chrome, but the best one might be Chromed Bird. It’s a fairly polished extension that lets you read and reply to tweets directly from within Chrome. It worked very well in my testing today, though you do have to share your username and password with the app (no OAuth support). Chromed Bird’s icon changes color when you have new tweets waiting, which is a nice visual cue, but the extension has no support for @reply or DM notifications, even though it has (non-working) tabs in the UI for filtering those types of messages. In all, Chromed Bird is very barebones, but functional as a basic, in-browser Twitter client. You should also check out Metrist, which is highly rated, but in Chinese (and I couldn’t get it to work properly). If you’re less concerned with tweeting, but would rather just stay up-to-date with tweets in your stream, then Twitter Ticker is a great extension to have. Once installed, the addon will scroll tweets in the bottom status bar of the browser as they happen. Holding your mouse over the scroll will pause it. On its own, that’s not very impressive, but when used in tandem with Chrome Bird — which, lacks advanced tweet notifications — Twitter Ticker is definitely very useful. Micro Last.fm is a very simple set of controls for Last.fm radio. It certainly lives up to its name by offering a super tiny UI that lives in the bottom status bar in Chrome. One of the nicest things about Micro Last.fm is that it doesn’t need your login credentials — and you don’t even need to be logged into Last.fm for it to work! The extension functions by opening up Last.fm radio in a new tab in Chrome, and then linking itself to that tab so you can control the radio station. There are a bunch of Google ReaderGoogle Reader addons for Chrome, but most just display your unread count or allow you to subscribe to feeds in Reader more easily. TPGoogleReader does a lot more than that, however. Made by the same person as Micro Last.fm, it is one of the most complete Google Reader extensions currently available for Chrome. Perhaps its most compelling feature is that you can set it to automatically open stories in a new tab in Chrome as they come into Google Reader and mark them as read. For heavy RSS readers that might be a nightmare, but for those subscribed in Google Reader to just a handful of feeds, the feature offers a way to get news pushed to you as it happens throughout the day without ever having to actually visit Google. Also check out Google Reader Checker, which just checks Reader for unread items, but does it in an elegant way. Facebook Notification Checker works just like Gmail Checker, but for FacebookFacebook. It adds an icon next to the address bar in Chrome that alerts you to new notifications in Facebook. In my testing it was a little finicky and didn’t always catch new notifications, but for avid Facebook users it will nonetheless be useful. One of the nicest features of Facebook Notification Checker is that it doesn’t require you to give it your username and password — you just need to be logged into Facebook in order for it to work.

Russian:","candidates_completions":"Manuel Estrada Sainz был хакерem ядра и поддерживал несколько пакетов в Debian, в том числе образовательную утилиту VisualOS, для которой он также был главным разработчиком. Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. Manuel Estrada Sainz (Мануэль Эстрада Сainz) - we begin with the proper name of the person to be translated. In Russian, names generally maintain their original order (first name, father's name, last name), but with the father's name written as a patronymic (using -вич or -vna for sons and daughters, respectively). However, in this context, we only provide the first and last name since patronymics are not typically used in English. 2. was (был) - a form of the verb 'to be' in past tense. This verb indicates the state of Manuel as a kernel hacker and package maintainer in the past. 3. a kernel hacker (хакер ядра) - this term is kept in English as it is a widely recognized term in computing, even in Russian-speaking circles. 4. and (и) - the conjunction 'and' is translated as 'и' in Russian. 5. maintained (поддерживал) - the verb 'to maintain' in past tense, indicating the ongoing action of taking care of and updating Debian packages. 6. a number of packages (несколько пакетов) - 'a number of' is a common English expression for an unspecified quantity, which translates to 'несколько' in Russian. 7. in Debian (в Debian) - this is a proper name of a Linux distribution and is maintained as such in the translation. 8. including (включая) - the preposition 'including' is translated as 'включая' in the sentence, demonstrating the list of items that follows, such as the VisualOS educational tool. 9. the VisualOS educational tool (образовательную утилиту VisualOS) - the noun phrase 'educational tool' is translated as 'образовательную утилиту', and the proper name VisualOS remains unchanged since it's an internationally recognized name and used in Russian-speaking communities as well. 10. for which (для которой) - in this case, the preposition 'for' introduces a relative clause to indicate which package Manuel maintained. The clause starts with the relative pronoun 'which', translated as 'которой' in Russian. 11. he was (он также был) - it is clarified that Manuel was not only the maintainer of the package but also its lead developer, so the pronoun 'he' is translated as 'он' and the verb 'was', as 'был'. 'Also' is added to clarify he had a dual role. 12. the lead developer (главным разработчиком) - this noun phrase describes the additional role Manuel had in the development of the VisualOS educational tool. It's translated as 'главным разработчиком', indicating he was the primary person responsible for the development of the software package. 13. as well (также) - this adverb emphasizes the dual roles Manuel had; it is translated as 'также' in Russian. It also serves as an additional link between the two descriptions emphasizing Manuel's multi-faceted contributions.,Мануэль Эстрада Сайнц был хаковщиком ядра и поддерживал множество пакетов в Debian, включая образовательную программу VisualOS, для которой он также работал своим ведущим разработчиком.

Each of them offers a unique perspective on the theme of prison breaks and escape.,Yes, both questions ultimately inquire about the same topic, which is the best films that center around prison break scenarios. \\"Prison Break-type movies\\" tend to focus on elaborate and often thrilling escape plans from high-security prisons. They can contain action, suspense, and sometimes even psychological elements, unraveling the human will to grasp freedom regardless of the circumstances. Popular prison break-style movies include: 1. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (1994): This film is considered a classic in the prison escape genre. It was based on Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\". Tim Robbins plays the role of Andy Dufresne, a banker sentenced to two consecutive life terms for a crime he claims he did not commit. His intellect and composed character take him through the roller-coaster ride of prison life, all the while plotting a meticulous escape. 2. \\"Escape from Alcatraz\\" (1979): This film tells the true story of three inmates who escaped from the maximum security prison of Alcatraz Island. Clint Eastwood plays the role of Frank Morris, a tough, intelligent character who spearheads the daring escape. 3. \\"The Great Escape\\" (1963): This iconic film is based on a true story from World War II. A group of American soldiers in a German POW camp create an elaborate plan to dig a tunnel and escape from their confinement. 4. \\"Papillon\\" (1973): The protagonist, played by Steve McQueen, is a falsely convicted man sent to a French penal colony in Guiana. He forms an alliance with a counterfeiter, played by Dustin Hoffman, in an attempt to escape the brutal conditions. The film has high drama with a gritty portrayal of prison life and several escape attempts. 5. \\"A Man Escaped\\" (1956): This French film tells the real-life escape story of André Devigny from the Montluc prison during World War II. 6. \\"Midnight Express\\" (1978): This is based on the true story of Billy Hayes, an American college student who gets caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey and is sentenced to more than 30 years in prison. The film mostly revolves around his multiple attempts to escape. 7. \\"Stalag 17\\" (1953): Set in a German POW camp during WWII, the story follows a group of American airmen who suspect that one among them is an informant. All the while, they plan an elaborate escape. 8. \\"Escape Plan\\" (2013): This modern film features Sylvester Stallone as a structural engineer who is wrongfully incarcerated in the maximum-security prison he designed. He then plans an elaborate escape. Another variation of the question would be \\"Which are the top-rated movies involving prison escapes?\\" or \\"What are some highly recommended movies about prison breakouts?\\" which again share the same sentiment inquiring about notable films in the escape genre.,Yes, both \\"What are the best Prison Break-type movies?\\" and \\"What are some best movies based on prison break out?\\" essentially ask for films that revolve around prison break plots. While \\"Prison Break-type movies\\" may refer to movies influenced or reminiscent of the TV series \\"Prison Break,\\" both questions aim to gather recommendations for movies featuring escape plots from prisons. So, both questions essentially have the same meaning. Here are some of the best prison escape movies that fit into the relevant category: 1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Directed by Frank Darabont, this critically acclaimed film based on Stephen King’s short story tells the tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover – a crime he did not commit. The story explores the depth of friendship between him and a fellow inmate, Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), as well as Andy's meticulously planned 19-year escape. 2. Brassed Off (1996) While not a typical escape movie, this British film directed by Mark Herman is about a struggling brass band in a Yorkshire mining town confronting the closure of their pit and the implications on their village. The film shows the resilience and unity among the community against adversity. The theme of survival and the spirit of enduring set it apart, making it a remarkable watch. 3. Papillon (1973) Charlton Heston and Steve McQueen star in this true story about a man falsely convicted of murder who is sentenced to serve time at the notorious Devil's Island penal colony. The story covers his desperate attempts to escape the harsh conditions of the island, and it received praise for its realistic portrayal of the experience of the prisoners and beautiful cinematography. 4. Escape from Alcatraz (1979) Clint Eastwood stars as Frank Morris, a real-life prisoner at the famous Alcatraz prison who, along with other prisoners, plans an elaborate escape. This film directed by Don Siegel offers a thrilling and tense take on prison escapes nevertheless gritty and grounded by its use of true-life events. 5. Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) This film written and directed by Don Siegel, features ambitious theme of progressive groups of people protesting against corruption resulting in a large-scale prison riot. This black and white film, bolstered by strong performances provides a unique perspective for jailbreak movies. 6. Escape from New York (1981) John Carpenter directs a dystopian sci-fi film that imagines New York City is a maximum-security prison which Snake Plissken a former war hero goes to anonymously rescue the president. This movie blends elements of action, science fiction, and crime into one thrilling concoction. 7. The Great Escape (1963) Often referred to as one of the best escape films, this classic tells the true story of a mass escape by a group of Allied prisoners of war from a German Luftwaffe-run POW camp during WW-2.

Article: Abstract Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the last decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal and Pacific Decadal Oscillations, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management. ||||| OSLO A rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine off the eastern United States has made the water too hot for cod, pushing stocks toward collapse despite deep reductions in the number of fish caught, a U.S. study showed on Thursday. The Gulf of Maine had warmed faster than 99 percent of the rest of the world's oceans in the past decade, influenced by shifts in the Atlantic Gulf Stream, changes in the Pacific Ocean and a wider trend of climate change, it said. Scientists said the findings showed a need to take more account of changing water temperatures in managing global fish stocks usually based on historical data of catches. Traditional calculations \\"consistently over-estimated the abundance of cod,\\" said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and lead author of the study in the journal Science. \\"Rapid changes outpaced our ability to recognize and react to what was happening in the water,\\" he told an online news conference. Fisheries managers cut cod quotas in recent years but cod numbers kept falling because the rapidly warming waters were making the Gulf of Maine inhospitable for the fish. From 2004, temperatures rose by more than 0.23 degree Celsius (0.4 Fahrenheit) a year, culminating in an ocean heat wave in the northwest Atlantic in 2012-13. And commercial cod landings fell to 1,000 tonnes in the Gulf of Maine in 2013, sliding from a recent high of 6,000 in 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. A U.N. climate report last year said that global warming was pushing many fish stocks toward the poles. Cod are thriving in cooler waters such as off Canada, Norway or Greenland. \\"The Gulf of Maine cod is a wake-up call\\" for better coordination between climate scientists and fisheries management, said Katherine Mills, one of the authors at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. She said it was unlikely that cod catches would recover to pre-crisis levels. The experts laid out scenarios that foresaw a recovery to 5,000 tonnes a year by 2030 in a warm scenario or to just 1,800 tonnes in a hot scenario.

They're In Hot Water Enlarge this image toggle caption Gulf of Maine Research Institute Gulf of Maine Research Institute Cod was once so plentiful in New England that legend had it you could walk across the local waters by stepping on the backs of the fish. Now, though, this tasty species is in such trouble there that cod fishing is practically shut down. And scientists say it looks like rapid warming in the Gulf of Maine explains why regulators' recent efforts to help the cod while allowing fishing were a failure. \\"Year after year, as they looked at the population, they realized that there were fewer cod than they expected there to be,\\" says Andrew Pershing, an oceanographer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. \\"They thought that they should be rebuilding, but they were actually declining.\\" At the same time the cod were mysteriously failing to rebound, he says, strange things were happening on the shores of Maine. People were finding seahorses, which almost never go that far north. \\"We had squid we don't normally find here,\\" recalls Pershing, \\"we had species like black sea bass that are normally found around Long Island that were hanging out in the lobster traps here in Maine.\\" These oddities were happening because the Gulf of Maine was warming. In the journal Science, Pershing and his colleagues say the warming was also hurting the cod — and managers didn't take it into account when setting their fishing quotas. That means even if people didn't exceed their quotas, too much cod got taken. \\"In really warm years, every female cod produces fewer babies than we would expect, and we also see that the young fish are less likely to survive and become adults,\\" says Pershing. Ecosystems all around the world are warming up due to global climate change, says Pershing, but the Gulf of Maine is ahead of the curve. Over the past decade, it's warmed faster than 99.9 percent of the global ocean. \\"That happened so fast that the people that were managing this very important fishery were not able to keep up with the changes,\\" he says. Enlarge this image toggle caption Gulf of Maine Research Institute Gulf of Maine Research Institute While fishery managers tend to make decisions based on past experience, he thinks that won't cut it when the environment is changing in truly unusual ways. Patrick Sullivan, a fishery management expert at Cornell University, says it's tough to say what lessons managers should take from this experience with cod. \\"The challenge, of course, is should we have known this, would we have known this? And in that sense it's challenging to say that we actually should have done something different here,\\" notes Sullivan. He says it's no easy job to predict how an environment will change — or how the fish will react. Still, he was pleased that the researchers who did this study say it looks like cod will be able to persist in the Gulf of Maine, despite the warming trend. \\"I was actually encouraged that, through appropriate management, if we take into account the environmental change, that these stocks can be rebuilt within a reasonable amount of time,\\" says Sullivan. But Pershing says rebuilding will look different in 2020 than it would in 1990. \\"Even with the lowest warming that we could find out of any of the climate model runs, we still end up with a population that's only about a half of what the population should have had in the 1990s,\\" says Pershing. \\"We're headed for a Gulf of Maine where there still should be cod, but where there will be fewer cod than there used to be. They will be a much smaller part of this ecosystem than they were 20 years ago.\\" ||||| The cod fishing industry in the Gulf of Maine is all but gone despite adherence to harvesting restrictions. A cod that will be auctioned off is held by Codie Small at the Portland Fish Exchange, Thursday, in Portland, Maine. Portland's Gulf of Maine Research Institute is announcing a major breakthrough in climate and fisheries science. A study published in the journal Science indicates cod, which have collapsed off of New England, are declining because of warming oceans. It’s a bad time to be a fish and chips lover in New England. Rapidly warming water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine are wreaking havoc on the cod population and fishing industries, according to a report published in Science magazine. Maine's gulf, a key fishing area that stretches from Cape Cod to Canada and touches Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, is warming too quickly for the cod in the area. The gulf has warmed faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans, the researchers found. Fishing managers say the area is at about 3 percent of sustainable levels and the fisheries could face even more drastic cuts to help replenish the population. Harvesting restrictions have been in place for quite some time, but because quota plans did not take warming waters into account, they have failed to adequately preserve the population, as The Christian Science Monitor reported earlier this week. \\"Rapid changes outpaced our ability to recognize and react to what was happening in the water,\\" Andrew Pershing, the lead author of the study, told an online news conference. \\"Every animal has a temperature range that they prefer. The Gulf of Maine, for cod, is really at the warm end of that,\\" Pershing told The Associated Press. \\"If you warm it, you push it somewhere that's really uncomfortable.\\" The decline in cod populations has devastated the commercial Atlantic cod industry in New England as well as Georges Bank. In 2001, 33 million pounds of cod were caught in those areas. In 2013, less than 5 million pounds was brought ashore. The shortage has driven the price of local cod sky high in New England and many restaurants are importing from Iceland and Norway. Other restaurants are using different kinds of fish completely. Cod are still thriving off Canada, Greenland, and many of the Nordic countries, which is in keeping with projections that global warming might be pushing many fish species to the poles, where the water is colder. \\"The Gulf of Maine cod is a wake-up call,\\" Katherine Mills, one of the authors of the Science report, told Reuters. Ms. Mills said it was unlikely that the Gulf of Maine region would ever recover to pre-crisis levels for cod. Experts have laid out a recovery plan for the species that is slowed by warming waters. This report includes material from The Associated Press and Reuters. ||||| What is a summary?","candidates_completions":"A summary is a concise and accurate restatement of the main points of a longer passage or article.

Rebekah, mother of three lovely little girls, was only 32, admitted for chemotherapy after breast-cancer surgery, When I gave her an injection, Rebekah shut her eyes tightly and murmured a prayer until it was over. Then she smiled and squeezed my hand. \\"Before you go, could you get my Bible from the table?\\" I handed her the worn book. \\"Do you have a favorite Bible verse?\\" she asked. \\"Jesus wept. John 11: 35.\\" \\"Such a sad one,\\" she said. \\"Why?\\"\\"It makes me feel closer to Jesus, knowing he also experienced human sorrow.\\" Rebekah nodded thoughtfully and started flipping through her Bible as I shut the door quietly behind me. During the following months, her hospital stays became frequent and she worried about her children. One day when I entered her room, I found her talking into a tape recorder. She picked up a notebook and held it out to me. \\"I'm making a tape for my daughters, \\" she said. I read the list on her pad: starting school, confirmation, turning 16, first date, graduation. While I worried how to help her deal with death, she was planning for her children's future. She usually waited until the early hours of the morning to record the tapes so she could be free from interruptions. She filled them with family stories and advice,trying to cram a lifetime of love into a few precious hours. Finally, every item in her notes had been checked off and she entrusted the tapes to her husband. I often wondered what I would say in her place.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Question: The author wrote the article mainly to _ .

Thermal inactivation of serum samples. Options are: I. different meanings; II. the same meaning;","candidates_completions":"Well buddy, the word \\"inactivation\\" is a bit like when you decide not to play with your toy for a while. Now in the first sentence, \\"The gene inactivation system.\\", here's what it's saying. There's some toy called \\"gene\\", but someone has decided not to let it play. So, they put all the pieces of the \\"gene\\" toy away for a little bit. This doesn't mean it's broken; it just means it's paused, and can be used later. So, in this case, \\"inactivation\\" refers to pausing a gene. In the second sentence, \\"Thermal inactivation of serum samples.\\", we're looking at a jigsaw puzzle called \\"serum samples\\". Someone is heating up the puzzle, but doing so is making the pieces of the puzzle become jumbled up. So, in this case, \\"inactivation\\" means something is being made jumbled up because of heat. Even though both sentences use the word \\"inactivation\\", the meaning isn't the same. So, the correct answer is I. Different meanings. The \\"inactivation\\" in the first sentence is about pausing, while the \\"inactivation\\" in the second sentence is about making things jumbled up because of heat., II. the same meaning; Even though the two sentences talk about different things, the word \\"inactivation\\" has the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"gene inactivation\\" means that the gene is turned off or not working anymore. In the second sentence, \\"thermal inactivation\\" means that the samples are being made inactive or ineffective through the use of heat. So even though the context is different, the action of inactivating is the same.,I. different meanings Okay, imagine that a gene is like a small instruction book that helps our body work, and serum samples are like a cup of juice. In the first sentence, \\"gene inactivation\\" means switching off that instruction book so it's not working anymore, like closing the book. In the second sentence, \\"thermal inactivation\\" means using heat to make the cup of juice inactive or not working like it used to, maybe making it safe to drink by killing germs. So, while both sentences use the word \\"inactivation,\\" they have different meanings because one is about an instruction book (gene) and the other is about a cup of juice (serum sample)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: ive been feeling weirdly superior about my knowledge of this book roundabouts now Output:","candidates_completions":"Step 1: Read and understand the sentence \\"I've been feeling weirdly superior about my knowledge of this book roundabouts now.\\" Step 2: Identify emotional cues The emotional cue in the sentence is \\"feeling weirdly superior.\\" Step 3: Analyze the emotional cue The emotional cue indicates that the speaker feels above others or better than others due to their knowledge of a book. Step 4: Compare the emotional cue to the list of emotions 'joy' - The speaker might feel some sense of accomplishment, but the overall feeling is not pure happiness or joy. 'love' - There isn't any indication of affection or strong emotional attachment. 'anger' - The speaker is not expressing resentment or frustration. 'fear' - No evidence of feeling afraid or threatened exists in the statement. 'surprise' - The emotion in the sentence does not communicate amazement or sudden shock. Step 5: Select the most appropriate emotion Since the statement does not obviously align with any of the six given emotions ('joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', or 'surprise'), I have to choose the one that seems the most appropriate. In this case, the feeling of \\"weirdly superior\\" seems to suggest mild delight or pleasure in one's own knowledge, which is closest to 'joy'. Output: 'joy',Output: 'surprise' Justification: In this sentence, the user is expressing a feeling of superiority due to their knowledge of the book. This could be an unexpected emotion, because it is not directly related to the familiarity with the content, but could be interpreted as a sign of surprise that the user's knowledge is superior., The emotion in the sentence appears to be 'joy'. This is inferred from the use of the word \\"superior\\", which suggests a feeling of pleasure or self-satisfaction, often associated with joy. Additionally, the phrase \\"feeling weirdly\\" implies a sense of comfort or amusement, which also supports the classification of the emotion as 'joy'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

HG Wells takes way to long to get to the point.It was annoying trying to finish this dull book. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","candidates_completions":"Based on the review provided, the product, in this case, the book by HG Wells, is depicted in an unflattering light. The review expresses dissatisfaction and negative feelings towards the book, highlighting issues such as the author taking too long to get to the point and the overall experience being dull and annoying. Therefore, potential readers might be dissuaded from purchasing or reading the book due to this unfavorable review.,This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses strong negative feelings towards the book by stating they \\"hated it.\\" They criticize the author, H.G. Wells, for taking too long to get to the point, which they found \\"annoying.\\" Additionally, they describe the book as \\"dull\\" and mention struggling to finish it. All these factors contribute to a negative portrayal of the product. The author's name being misspelled as \\"Wells\\" instead of \\"Welles\\" further emphasizes the unflattering nature of the review by presenting the identification of the author, simply one of the most celebrated science fiction novelists, in a ham-fisted and inaccurate manner.,This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light for numerous reasons. The reviewer's use of strong negative language, dissatisfaction with the pacing, and the overall tone all contribute to an unfavorable perception of the product. By analyzing the review, we can pinpoint specific aspects that led to this unfavorable representation. 1. Use of strong negative language: The reviewer starts with the title \\"It sucked\\" and states \\"I hated it.\\" Such strong negative expressions immediately imply a negative opinion about the product and indicate that the reviewer had a deeply unfavorable experience with it. 2. Criticism of pacing: The reviewer mentions that HG Wells takes way too long to get to the point, which can be interpreted as a lack of engagement and dissatisfaction with the storytelling style. This criticism could possibly discourage potential readers who might be looking for faster-paced narratives or high levels of excitement throughout the book. 3. Difficulty in finishing the book: The reviewer's statement that it was annoying trying to finish the book suggests that it was a struggle to persist with the story until the end. This reinforces the negative impression, as it illustrates a lack of enjoyable or compelling content that would have kept the reader engaged. 4. Overall tone: The review has an overall negative and dismissive tone, which can potentially influence other readers' perception of the product. By sharing an unfavorable experience, it may lead others to think that they, too, would not enjoy the book and may deter them from considering it as a reading option. In conclusion, the review depicts the product in a highly unflattering light by utilizing strong negative language, expressing dissatisfaction with the book's pacing, noting the struggle in finishing it, and employing a generally negative tone. These factors combine to create an unfavorable representation of the product that could impact other potential readers' perception of it and discourage them from considering it for their reading list."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From then on, not only he could read his favorite book whenever he wanted, but also have a neat and safe home for it. And they all lived happily ever after., Oh no, the boy tried to put the big book on a shelf, but the shelf is too narrow! That means the shelf is not wide enough for the big book to fit properly. So, when the boy tried to put the book there, it fell down to the ground. Maybe the boy can find a different shelf that is wide enough for the big book, or he could ask an adult for help to make the current shelf wider. Isn't it fun to solve little problems like these?,Once upon a time, there was a little boy who had lots of books in his house. One day, he found a big, thick book and wanted to put it on a shelf that was specially made for smaller, thinner books called paperbacks. Now, let me explain, little buddy. A paperback is a book with a soft cover, and they are usually smaller and thinner than other books. The shelf was designed to hold these smaller books. So, the boy tried his best to put the big book on the shelf meant for the paperbacks. But guess what happened? The big book fell to the ground! This happened because the shelf was too narrow for the big book to fit on it. In other words, the shelf that was meant for the smaller, thinner books couldn't hold the big, thick book because it wasn't wide enough. The little boy realized that he needed a different shelf, one that was big enough to hold his big book. So, he went on a search for the perfect shelf that would fit his huge book and keep it safe. And that's what happens when you try to put something large on a place meant for smaller things, my young friend. The little boy had to learn which shelf was best suited for each type of book. Just like we learn that some toys fit in our small toy box and bigger ones need a larger space to be stored in."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its editor was William Johnson Fox and its owner was James Harmer , a London alderman . Its editor was William Johnson Fox , and its owner was James Harmer , a London sweater . Choices: + no. + yes. The answer is:","candidates_completions":"no. While both sentences discuss the editor and owner of something, presumably a publication, there are differences in the descriptions of the owner. In the first sentence, James Harmer is described as a \\"London alderman\\" whereas in the second sentence, he is described as a \\"London sweater.\\" These two terms convey different meanings and roles. A \\"London alderman\\" refers to an individual holding a position of authority within the local government of London. This person is generally a member of the City council, involved in decision-making processes, and represents the interests of their ward or constituents. On the other hand, a \\"London sweater\\" is an inaccurate term, as sweaters are pieces of clothing and do not hold any position or role. If it was intended to describe a profession, it would still be different from the role of an alderman. Thus, the two sentences do not have the same meaning due to the differences in the description of James Harmer's role or profession.,no. The two sentences do not have the same meaning because the second sentence contains a typo, mistakenly referring to James Harmer as a \\"London sweater.\\" In reality, James Harmer was a London alderman, which is a position in local government. A London sweater would not make sense in this context, as it is not a position or title but rather a piece of clothing. The correct version would be \\"Its editor was William Johnson Fox, and its owner was James Harmer, a London alderman.\\" This statement maintains the intended context and provides accurate information about the editor and owner of the publication., No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. The difference lies in the occupation attributed to James Harmer. In the first sentence, James Harmer is referred to as a \\"London alderman,\\" while in the second sentence, he is called a \\"London sweater.\\" An alderman is a member of a municipal council, typically in a city or town, who has been elected or appointed to serve a term of office. This position is often associated with legislative duties and decision-making at the local government level. On the other hand, a sweater is a term that is not typically associated with a professional occupation. Instead, it refers to a type of knitted garment worn to keep warm. Given its common usage, it seems unlikely that James Harmer was known as a \\"London sweater\\" in a professional context.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! and the situation: Two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere in class. They also started studying Venus' atmosphere.

What is the answer to this question? the fibula is found in which region of the appendicular skeleton?","candidates_completions":"To answer the question, I will first need to understand the different regions of the appendicular skeleton and the location of the fibula. Step 1: Define the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs and their attachment to the axial skeleton, which are the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Step 2: Understand the regions of the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton is divided into the following regions: - The upper extremities (shoulders, arms, forearms, wrists, and hands) - The lower extremities (hips, thighs, legs, ankles, and feet) - The pectoral girdle (the bones that connect the upper limbs to the axial skeleton) - The pelvic girdle (the bones that connect the lower limbs to the axial skeleton) Step 3: Identify the location of the fibula. The fibula is one of the two bones in the lower leg, located opposite the tibia (the larger of the two bones). Together, the tibia and fibula form the connection between the knee and the ankle. Step 4: Determine the region where the fibula is found. Since the fibula is one of the bones in the lower leg, it is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton. Thus, the answer to the question is that the fibula is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton.,Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for the region in the appendicular skeleton where the fibula is found. Step 2: Refresh my knowledge on the appendicular skeleton and its regions The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs (upper and lower) and their attachments to the axial skeleton (pelvis and shoulder girdle). It includes the pectoral girdle, upper limb bones (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges), pelvic girdle, and lower limb bones (femur, patella, tibia, fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges). Step 3: Determine the location of the fibula The fibula is a small, thin bone located on the lateral (outside) aspect of the lower leg, along with the larger tibia bone. It connects to the tibia at the knee joint and forms a bony ankle joint in conjunction with the talus bone of the foot. Step 4: Identify the appropriate region Since the fibula is a component of the lower limb, it belongs to the appendicular skeleton. Step 5: Provide an answer The fibula is found in the lower limb region of the appendicular skeleton., The appendicular skeleton is composed of the upper and lower limbs along with the shoulders and the pelvis. The fibula is a bone located in the lower limb, specifically in the leg. To justify this answer, let's examine the structure of the appendicular skeleton in more detail: 1. The appendicular skeleton is divided into two major parts: the upper limbs (including the shoulders) and the lower limbs (including the hips and legs). 2. In the lower limb, there are two bones in the leg: the femur (thigh bone) and the fibula. 3. The fibula is a thin, slender bone located laterally (on the outside) of the lower leg. It runs parallel to the tibia, which is the larger, more robust bone in the leg. 4. The fibula plays a crucial role in stabilizing the ankle joint and is not a weight-bearing bone, unlike the tibia. Therefore, the fibula is found in the region of the appendicular skeleton that includes the lower limbs, specifically in the leg."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: In 1979, the Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commencing on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK programming. What is the answer to this question: Who first developed consumer HD television with a 5:3 aspect ratio?","candidates_completions":"The Japanese state broadcaster, NHK, was the first organization to develop consumer high-definition (HD) television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. They developed this system in 1979, and it was known as Hi-Vision or MUSE (Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding) after its encoding method for the signal. The MUSE system provided about four times the resolution compared to the existing NTSC system, with approximately 1080i/1125 lines. NHK initiated satellite test broadcasts in 1989, followed by regular testing in 1991. The first regular HD broadcasting via the BS-9ch channel commenced on November 25, 1994, featuring both commercial and NHK programming.,The Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio. This breakthrough occurred in 1979 and represented a significant advancement in television technology. The system they developed was known as Hi-Vision or MUSE, which stands for Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding. This moniker refers to the method that was used to encode the broadcast signal. NHK's Hi-Vision or MUSE system was innovative and ground-breaking in terms of its technical specifications. It required about twice the bandwidth of the previous NTSC system, which was the standard at the time. Despite requiring a higher amount of bandwidth, the MUSE system was able to deliver a vastly superior resolution. Specifically, it provided about four times the resolution of the NTSC system, with 1080 interlaced lines, or 1125 lines in total. The development and implementation of this system was a methodical process. Satellite test broadcasts of this new high-definition format began about ten years later, in 1989. After these preliminary tests, a more regular testing schedule was initiated in 1991. The results of this period of extensive testing culminated in the start of regular broadcasting of BS-9ch on November 25, 1994. BS-9ch broadcast included both commercial programming and programming produced by NHK. So in summary, the seminal development of consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio was first undertaken by the Japanese state broadcaster NHK in 1979. This system was a significant leap forward in televisual technology, providing much higher resolution and enhanced picture quality compared to existing systems, albeit at the cost of requiring a higher bandwidth for transmission.,The Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio in 1979."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - The Silver Star, officially the Silver Star Medal, is the United States military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat.

An asterisk after a recipient 's name indicates that the award was given posthumously . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force.

This control center function is most similar to the computer room that controls the assembly process in a car factory. The other choices perform important roles in a factory but do not have the same degree of control and regulation as a nucleus does within a living cell., The nucleus of a living cell is most similar to choice C). the computer room that controls the assembly process. This is because the nucleus of a cell contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, which is used to control the activities of the cell. This genetic material is responsible for the creation of proteins and other essential materials within the cell, similar to how a computer controls the operations of a factory. The other options do not accurately reflect the role of the nucleus. A conveyor belt transports materials but does not control the production process. A storage bin holds materials but does not direct their use. And while energy is indeed crucial for cell function, the nucleus does not provide this energy; it is more involved in the control and regulation of the cell's activities.,C). the computer room that controls the assembly process. The nucleus of a living cell can be compared to the computer room in a factory that produces cars, for the following reasons: 1. The nucleus is the cell's control center, whereas the computer room in the factory serves a similar purpose by controlling the assembly process and ensuring that it functions correctly. 2. Just like a computer Room in a factory monitors and coordinates the flow of information between different parts of the factory, the nucleus in a living cell contains the genetic information and regulates the cell's activities by synthesizing RNA and controlling gene expression. 3. Both the nucleus in a living cell and the computer room in the factory contribute to maintaining the overall balance and functioning of the entire system. To recap, the nucleus is the most similar to the computer room that controls the assembly process in a car-producing factory because it both serves as a central control center for managing genetic information and regulating cell activities."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The pressure of a sample of gas is measured with an open-end manometer, partially shown to the right.

Write some highlights for the following article: The worlds of politics and arts mingled Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with President Barack Obama among those toasting five stars of stage, screen and music. \\"Each of them has been blessed with an extraordinary gift,\\" the president said of the night's honorees. \\"Tonight, we thank them for sharing that gift with us.\\" The festivities in Washington began with a White House reception, where Obama made his remarks flanked by the honorees. People moved from there across town to The Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River for a gala performance. The performing arts space, named in honor of the late President John F. Kennedy, is marking its 40th anniversary this year, and this is the 34th time that it has honored individuals in a \\"celebration of the arts.\\" Past honorees run an entertainment gamut -- from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery in the movie world, to Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan in music, to Ginger Rogers and Mikhail Baryshnikov in dance, among dozens of others. This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and \\"America\\" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website. Legendary saxophonist and composer Sonny Rollins has long stood out on the jazz scene even while playing alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Atlanta-bred musical theater star Barbara Cook made her mark on Broadway. She's also toured the world and produced several studio albums. Yo-Yo Ma -- described in his biography as the nation's \\"cellist-in-chief\\" -- has won 16 Grammy awards over his illustrious career and last year was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sunday night's only non-musical winner is actress Meryl Streep. She burst on the movie scene in 1978 in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" later winning plaudits for her roles in films such as \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" \\"Out of Africa\\" and more recently \\"Julie & Julia.\\" \\"We're just over the moon about this,\\" Cook said of her conversations with the four others about being celebrated Sunday. \\"It's once in a lifetime -- there's nothing else like this.\\" Others attending Sunday's events included actors Stanley Tucci, Robert DeNiro, Sarah Jessica Parker and Emily Blunt, and musician Smokey Robinson. They were joined by political players including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, GOP presidential contender Newt Gingrich, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Several of them -- including DeNiro, Tucci and Robinson -- took the Kennedy Center on Sunday night to celebrate the honorees. Others who spoke included Bill Cosby on behalf of Rollins, Jennifer Nettles and Lionel Ritchie for Diamond, and Stephen Colbert toasting Yo-Yo Ma. A two-hour recap of the gala will air the night of December 27 on CBS. Obama ended his lighthearted remarks Sunday evening with a call for people to support the arts, ideally helping a future Kennedy Center honoree and many others have the tools and opportunities they need to excel. \\"Let's make sure that our young people can dream big dreams and follow them as long as they can go,\\" the president said. That sentiment was seconded on the red carpet by, among others, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \\"The arts are a very good investment because they're about the spirit of America (and) they encourage children to learn, to gain confidence through exercising their creativity,\\" the California Democrat said. \\"Imagination is what keeps us number one.\\"","candidates_completions":"The Kennedy Center Honors is a yearly event where important people in politics and arts gather to celebrate famous stars of theater, movies, and music.

Article: You have several options when choosing a modelling clay to sculpt your face. Each clay is different, so choose the clay that best suits your purposes. Ceramic clays are water-based and easy to work with right out of the bag. It needs to stay moist while being worked, as it can dry out and crack. Ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture. Plasteline clay is an oil-based clay that doesn't dry out, and can't be fire hardened. It is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail. Polymer clays require an armature, or a wire skeleton, for support. They are weaker than other clays, but are good for painting. Polymer clays can be fire hardened, though they are not as hard as ceramic clays. Aside from the clay, you'll need a few other things before you can start sculpting. A good, clean working area is necessary, as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture. You can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores. You don't have to buy specialized tools for sculpting. It may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose. The main functions of your tools are to cut, scrape, and shape the clay. You can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay, and add detail. If you know the person whose face you are sculpting, take pictures of them from all angles. Try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera. Take some from the side as well to get a good profile. If you're basing your sculpture on a famous person, find photos on the internet and print them out. Make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person's proportions. It may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features. Think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture. Think about who they are, what they do, and why you want to sculpt them. Use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would Jennifer see more or less sunsets in Malarn? Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. A:","candidates_completions":"Jennifer would likely see more sunsets in Malarn. According to the provided information, Malarn regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean.

The paragraph states that Malarn gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. The presence of this dust can lead to an increase in red sunsets, adding to the visual appeal of sunset views in Malarn compared to Trainlan., Based on the information provided, Jennifer would likely see more sunsets in Malarn than in Trainlan. This is because Malarn is frequently affected by dust from the Sahara desert, which is carried by trade winds into southeastern North America. When this dust is present, it can lead to an increase in red sunsets. In contrast, there is no mention of Trainlan being affected by similar dust outbreaks. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that Jennifer would be more likely to experience more (and possibly more vibrant) sunsets in Malarn. However, it's important to note that the frequency and intensity of dust outbreaks can vary from year to year, and there are other factors (such as weather conditions and time of year) that can influence the appearance of sunsets. Additionally, Jennifer's personal preferences and lifestyle may play a more significant role in her decision to move to Malarn or Trainlan than the number of sunsets she would see in either city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Question: What is the opposite of little? Options: - least - much - bog - lot of - big The answer is \\"big\\" because The answer is:","candidates_completions":"big The opposite of little can be understood in a few ways: size, quantity, or degree. In terms of size, the opposite of something small or little is something big or large. Big refers to a larger size in comparison to little or small. In terms of quantity or degree, the opposite is something that is many or abundant - in this case, \\"a lot of\\" or \\"much\\" would be the suitable counterparts to \\"little\\", assuming more refers to a greater quantity or intensity. Least and Big can also be used in a similar way. For example: If we talk about a little bit of water, its opposite would be a considerable amount of water, “big”. Similarly, something \\"little\\" in terms of importance may be described as \\"least\\" or inferior; with \\"big\\" being its direct opposite in this context - referring to a thing being more influential or significant. As for the term \\"bog\\", it does not have a direct opposite to \\"little\\" in any of the contexts mentioned. It's a term referring to wet, spongy ground, and therefore doesn't fit in the presented context. Nevertheless, to answer the question, \\"big\\" stands as the direct opposite of \\"little\\" based on the extent, magnitude, or level of any property considered. It represents a contrast to the diminutive character of something labeled \\"little\\" in size, degree, or number., The word \\"big\\" is the opposite of \\"little.\\" This is because these words are antonyms, which means they have opposite meanings. \\"Little\\" is an adjective that describes something as small in size, amount, or degree. It can also mean young or unimportant. For example, you might say \\"I have a little brother\\" or \\"I only have a little bit of milk left.\\" On the other hand, \\"big\\" is an adjective that describes something as large in size, amount, or degree. It can also mean important or impressive. For example, you might say \\"I have a big house\\" or \\"I have a big test tomorrow.\\" Therefore, because \\"little\\" and \\"big\\" have opposite meanings, \\"big\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What is the opposite of little?\\" The other options provided (\\"least,\\" \\"much,\\" \\"bog,\\" and \\"lot of\\") are not antonyms for \\"little.\\" \\"Least\\" is a superlative adjective that means the smallest in amount or degree, \\"much\\" is an adverb that means to a great degree, \\"bog\\" is a noun that refers to a soft wet area of land, and \\"lot of\\" is an expression that means a large quantity or amount. Therefore, none of these options are correct as the opposite of \\"little.\\",\\"big\\". In language terminology, antonyms are words that have contrasting, or opposite, meanings. Therefore, when examining the semantic connection between the words \\"little\\" and \\"big\\", we find they are antonyms. Here's why: \\"Little\\" is generally defined as small in size, amount, or degree. The term is used to depict something that is not large or significant in some way and is often used to describe physical size, amounts, and structures or items. This relates to its usage in sentences like \\"That's a little book\\" or \\"There's little food left.\\" On the other hand, the term \\"big\\" is used to describe something that is large in size, volume, amount, or degree. It represents a condition where an item or situation is considerably above the average or ordinary in scope or magnitude. This reflects its use in phrases like \\"That's a big house\\" or \\"There's a big difference between the two.\\" Therefore, by their inherent and generally accepted meanings, \\"big\\" is the correct antithetical term to \\"little\\" because it represents the exact inverse - large instead of small. Let's take a glance at the other options as well for completeness: - \\"Least\\" is not an exact antonym to \\"little.\\" \\"Least\\" is the superlative form of \\"less\\" and often suggests a lower degree or the lowest degree of something. Moreover, \\"least\\" generally does not reflect physical size, unlike \\"little.\\" - \\"Much\\" can indicate a large quantity, volume or degree of something, but it does not directly refer to physical size. Therefore, it is not as precise an antonym for \\"little,\\" which often implies small in physical dimensions. - \\"Bog\\" is a word that signifies a wet, muddy ground too soft to support a heavy body. It does not represent an antonym for \\"little.\\" - \\"Lot of\\" could mean a large amount in quantity but does not suggest anything about the physical size, making it an unsuitable direct antonym for \\"little.\\" Given this analysis, the correct answer is \\"big.\\" It mirrors the opposite meaning of \\"little\\" encompassing all its uses, particularly those referring to physical dimension, making it the most accurate choice from the options provided."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -198 = -20*x - 13*x for x.","candidates_completions":"To solve the equation -198 = -20x - 13x, the first step is to combine like terms on the right side of the equation. This means combining -20x and -13x. -198 = (-20 - 13)x -198 = -33x Next, we want to isolate x, which means getting it by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -33. x = -198 / -33 x = 6 So, the solution to the equation -198 = -20x - 13x is x = 6. We can verify this by plugging 6 in for x and seeing if both sides of the equation are equal. -198 = -20(6) - 13(6) -198 = -120 - 78 -198 = -198 Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that the solution x = 6 is correct.,The given math problem is: Solve -198 = -20*x - 13*x for x. We start by combining the like terms on the right-hand side of the equation: -198 = (-20 - 13) * x -198 = -33*x Now we need to isolate the variable x: Divide both sides by -33: -198 / -33 = x x = 6 So the solution to the equation -198 = -20*x - 13*x is x = 6.,To solve this equation, -198 = -20*x - 13*x, for x, first combine the terms with x on the same side of the equation. 1. Combine the x terms: -20x - 13x can be combined into a single term: -33x. So the equation becomes: -198 = -33x 2. Isolate the variable x: To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is -33. -198 / -33 = (-33x) / -33 3. Solve for x: Divide -198 by -33: -198 / -33 = 6 So the equation -198 = -33x becomes 6 = x. 4. Check the result: To double-check the correctness of the obtained result, substitute x with 6 back into the original equation: -198 = -20*(6) - 13*(6) -198 = -120 - 78 -198 = -198 Since the two sides of the equation match, the solution x=6 is correct."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Review: The first time I ordered this product, it was never received and this prompted a poor review. However, when the seller realized my concern, a second order was promptly sent. I appreciate this very much. I will order again from this seller. Answer: Answer:","candidates_completions":"The tone of this product review is primarily positive, despite the initial negative experience mentioned by the reviewer. The fact that the seller quickly addressed the issue and sent a replacement order demonstrates good customer service, which the reviewer appreciated and acknowledged. The reviewer's decision to order again from the same seller also indicates their satisfaction with the resolution of the issue. However, it is important to note that the review does start with a negative experience, which could potentially create a negative impression. But overall, the reviewer's positive evaluation of the seller's response outweighs the initial negative experience, resulting in a predominantly positive tone. It is also worth mentioning that the reviewer's use of phrases like \\"promptly sent\\" and \\"I will order again\\" convey a sense of trust and confidence in the seller, which further contributes to the positive tone of the review. In conclusion, while the review does include a negative experience, the reviewer's positive evaluation of the seller's response results in an overall positive tone.,The tone of this product review initially starts off as negative, but ultimately shifts to a positive tone by the end of the review. At the beginning of the review, the customer states that they never received the product after placing their order and subsequently left a poor review. This clearly indicates a negative tone, as the customer encountered an unsatisfactory and frustrating experience. The mention of the previous negative review further emphasizes dissatisfaction with their initial transaction. However, the tone of the review changes as it progresses. The customer acknowledges the seller's prompt attention to their concern and expresses their appreciation when a second order was sent without delay. This demonstrates a shift to a positive tone, as the customer believes the seller took their complaint seriously and made an effort to rectify the situation to their satisfaction. The customer's sentiment turns positive as their issue was addressed efficiently and effectively. By the end of the review, the customer expresses their willingness to order again from the seller, further reinforcing the overall positive tone. Although their initial experience was less than desirable, the seller's attentive customer service ultimately wins over the disappointed buyer, resulting in a predominantly positive tone for the review. The customer's statement that they \\"will order again from this seller\\" can be seen as a recommendation, which is a clear indication that the customer has a favorable view of the seller despite the initial negative experience.,The tone of this product review is generally positive. Initially, the reviewer expressed a negative experience with their first order not being received, which led to a bad review. However, the positive tone quickly emerges as the seller quickly responded to the concern, took responsibility for the issue, and promptly sent a second order to the customer. The reviewer then shows their gratitude for the satisfactory resolution and explicitly mentions that they would order again from the seller. Overall, the positive tone prevails, even though the initial negative experience was acknowledged."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening. When I think of the films that are shown at festivals, I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. There's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making. By \\"mainstream,\\" I mean more like a film produced for national release - In other words, a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater. The writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. There is nothing typically independent about this film. As an aspiring director, I am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. This is one of those films. As I watched The Big Bad Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. When a movie makes me feel like that, I know it's really good. This is the first feature-length project from Ishai Setton and I found myself wishing that It had been my project. For me, that's really rare. See this film. It's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. Paget Brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance. She has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. That's a gift. I think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also did top-notch jobs.

The task can be broken down into the following steps: 1. We are given three inputs: two integers \`i\` and \`j\`, and a list \`A\`. 2. The integers \`i\` and \`j\` represent the starting and ending indices, respectively, for a subset of the list \`A\`. 3. However, instead of listing the elements from \`i\` to \`j\` in their original order, we need to list them in the reverse order. Using the guidelines provided, let's solve the task with the given input: * Input: \`i = 1\`, \`j = 5\`, and \`A = '4697', 'k', '5539', 'n', '1049', '7957', '3501', 'Q', 'C', '893', '9287'\` * Since \`i = 1\`, the subset of \`A\` we're interested in starts at the second element (since indices start at 0). * Since \`j = 5\`, the subset of \`A\` we're interested in ends at the sixth element. * We need to list the subset of \`A\` in reverse order, so we start with the sixth element and end with the second element: \`'1049', '5539', 'k'\`. Therefore, the output should be \`'1049', '5539', 'k'\`.,In this task, we are given three inputs: i, j, and A. We need to return a list of elements from A starting from the ith element to the jth element, but in reverse order. i and j are integers and non-negative. i is always less than j, and both i and j are less than the length of A. Inputs: i = 1 j = 5 A = '4697', 'k', '5539', 'n', '1049', '7957', '3501', 'Q', 'C', '893', '9287' Steps to solve the task: 1. Select elements from A starting from the ith element to the jth element. 2. Reverse the order of the selected elements. Step 1: Select elements from A from the 1st element to the 5th element (Note: Python lists start from index 0). Selected_elements = A1:6 = 'k', '5539', 'n', '1049', '7957' Step 2: Reverse the order of the selected elements.

To provide a detailed answer, the James Bond film \\"Skyfall\\" did indeed encounter administrative issues while trying to film in another country besides Mexico, and that country was India. The production team initially planned to shoot some scenes for the pre-title sequence in India, particularly in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan. However, they faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary permits from local authorities, leading them to move the production to Istanbul, Turkey. The reasons for the permit issues in India are not explicitly stated in the sources, but it is mentioned that the Indian authorities requested several changes to the script, including cutting a scene involving a chase on motorbikes through a marketplace and deleting a scene where James Bond (played by Daniel Craig) would have posed as a polo player from Delhi. These demands led to the production moving to Istanbul, where they found suitable locations for the chase sequence, including the Grand Bazaar and the roof of the city's Spice Market. Eventually, Istanbul became an integral part of the film's pre-title sequence, offering spectacular visuals and serving as an exciting backdrop for the opening scenes. In summary, besides Mexico, the James Bond film \\"Skyfall\\" encountered administrative issues in India during pre-production while trying to secure permits for shooting the film's pre-title sequence.,Yes, the statement \\"Production of Skyfall had previously faced similar problems while attempting to secure permits to shoot the film's pre-title sequence in India before moving to Istanbul.\\" contains the correct answer to the question, \\"In what other country, besides Mexico, did the film experience administrative issues with local authorities?\\" The country mentioned in the statement is India. The administrative issues faced by the production team of Skyfall in India were problems in securing the required permits for shooting the film's pre-title sequence. This clearly suggests that, besides Mexico, the film also experienced administrative challenges with local authorities in India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which type of data would best be displayed on a circle graph? What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?

Explanation of the steps: 1. Circles are usually used to visualize data that can be compared in terms of relative size, since each part of the circle's circumference can be assigned to a specific value. 2. Among the given options, the one that involves comparing relative sizes is the percentage of various materials in solid waste, where each data point can be represented by a section of the circle's circumference. 3. Therefore, a circle graph would best be used to represent the percentage of various materials in solid waste, making the correct choice option v.,Step 1: Analyze the question and the options provided. The question is asking which type of data is best displayed on a circle graph. Step 2: Define circle graph. A circle graph, also known as a pie chart, is a type of graph that displays data in a circular form where each category is represented by a separate slice or section with its size proportional to the data percentage it represents. Circle graphs are most effective for showing proportions or percentages of a whole. Step 3: Evaluate each option and determine which data would best be displayed on a circle graph. i. the distance of the planets from the sun; This data is not about percentages or proportions, but rather about distances. Thus, a circle graph would not be the most suitable choice for this information. ii. the depths of the major oceans on Earth; This information is also about depths and not proportions or percentages. A circle graph would not be ideal for displaying this data. iii. the amount of rainfall each day for a month; This data is best represented in a bar graph or a line graph, as it shows daily measurements over time. A circle graph would not effectively convey this information. iv. the percent of various materials in solid waste; This data is about percentages or proportions of various materials in solid waste, making it ideal for display in a circle graph as it effectively communicates how each material contributes to the total amount of solid waste. Step 4: Choose the option that best fits the criteria for use in a circle graph. Based on the analysis, option iv. the percent of various materials in solid waste is the correct answer, as this data would best be displayed on a circle graph due to its focus on proportions or percentages of a whole., The correct answer is option (iv) - the percent of various materials in solid waste. A circle graph, also known as a pie chart, is best used to show the proportion or percentage of different categories that make up a whole. In this case, displaying the percent of various materials in solid waste would be an appropriate use of a circle graph because it allows for a clear visual representation of how much each material contributes to the total percentage of solid waste. For example, plastic, paper, and metal can be shown as slices of the pie, with their sizes proportional to the percentage they represent."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Hindi language and we ask you to translate those to the English language.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the real first name of the woman that the arrogant songwriter becomes romantically involved with? The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.

Possible A: country, park, town, countryside, near Why is \\"town\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","candidates_completions":"\\"Town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because, in most cases, public facilities like soccer fields are usually located in areas with higher population density, such as towns or cities. This is because a greater number of people in these areas would be able to make use of the field and enjoy it. Additionally, towns usually have resources and infrastructure such as maintenance staff, public transportation, and walking/biking paths to support public spaces such as a soccer field. The countryside, on the other hand, might not have the same level of public infrastructure or resources to maintain such facilities for a smaller population. Therefore, it is sensible to assume that the soccer field would be located in a town.,\\"Town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons and justifications: 1. Availability and accessibility: A town typically has various amenities available for its residents, including recreational facilities like a soccer field. It is reasonable to assume that a soccer field might be located in a town since towns are designed to cater to the needs of their citizens. 2. Community gathering: A town often serves as a gathering place for the community. Sports fields, including soccer fields, may be located in towns to provide residents with a common space to gather, socialize, and participate in recreational activities. 3. Population density: Towns typically have a higher population density compared to rural areas such as the countryside. This means that there are more people concentrated in a smaller area, leading to an increased demand for recreational facilities like a soccer field. 4. Maintenance and management: A town usually has a local government or administration responsible for ensuring public spaces, including sports facilities, are well maintained and managed. This makes it more likely for a soccer field to be located in a town, as it would receive proper care and supervision. 5. Comparing the other options: a. Country and countryside: These two options are similar and refer to rural areas. While it's possible for a soccer field to be located in a country/countryside setting, it is less common due to lower population density and fewer amenities. b. Park: A park is a possible location for a soccer field, but it is not as comprehensive an answer as \\"town,\\" since a park can commonly be found within a town or an urban setting. c. Near: The term \\"near\\" doesn't provide enough context or specificity to be a stand-alone answer. Considering these factors, \\"town\\" aligns well with human common sense when it comes to the potential location of a soccer field., \\"Town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because towns often have community spaces for recreational activities, and a soccer field is a common recreational facility. Additionally, towns usually have sufficient space to accommodate a soccer field, and they are likely to have proper maintenance and security compared to more remote locations like the countryside. Furthermore, towns tend to have a higher population density, which would increase the demand and usage of a soccer field."},{"prompt":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Freemasonry: The idea of Masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What can be considered a Volume of Sacred Math?","candidates_completions":"That's a very interesting question! You see, a \\"Volume of Sacred Law\\" in Freemasonry is a book that contains divine revelations, like the Bible, Quran, or Torah. These books are considered sacred by different religions.

So, a Volume of Sacred Math doesn't really exist, because it's not something we see in this context.,Well, kiddo, Freemasonry is like a big group of friends who make special promises to support and help each other. They use special books to make these promises. Most of the time, they use a special book called the Bible. But sometimes, people have other special books that are important to them.

Q: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. According to the above context, answer the following question. Whose front door had the word \\"paedo\\" painted on it?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \\"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography. A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series. A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\\"O'Keeffe's Ghost\\") in January 2006, \\"in honor of Georgia O'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\\".

And the generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility, that is to have reasonable probability of it being true. Se siete sposati, non fate a turno la preparazione del cibo. Output:","candidates_completions":"Se siete coniugati, mangiate insieme e condividete le preparazioni culinarie. Step 1: In the given sentence, \\"siete sposati\\" can be replaced with \\"siete coniugati\\", which has a similar meaning. Step 2: Instead of \\"non fate a turno\\", the sentence can be altered to\\"mangiate insieme\\", suggesting that as a couple, the person should eat together rather than taking turns. Step 3: Lastly, \\"la preparazione del cibo\\" can be changed to \\"le preparazioni culinarie\\", maintaining the focus on food preparation while making it semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. Output sentence: Se siete coniugati, mangiate insieme e condividete le preparazioni culinarie.,Se siete in coppia, non delegate a turno la pulizia della casa. Reasoning step-by-step: 1. I understand the input sentence is about a situation in a married life where spouses are advised not to take turns in preparing food. 2. The first change I make is replacing the word \\"sposati\\" with \\"in coppia\\". Both mean being in a relationship, but the latter is more general, not necessarily implying marriage. 3. Next, I change the context from cooking to another common household chore, cleaning the house. This change keeps the overall message similar and is semantically related. 4. Then, I make an additional small change in the verb used for describing the action. The word \\"fate\\" is replaced by the verb \\"delegate\\", which adds a little bit of difference, while still keeping the sentence structurally and semantically similar to the original. 5. These changes result in a sentence that has a high commonsense plausibility; it’s reasonable in many relationships for couples not to take turns in cleaning the house. It fits into the real-world expectations of tasks within a relationship., Se siete genitori, non fate a turno a prendervi cura dei figli. Explanation: 1. First, I break down the original sentence: \\"If you are married, don't take turns preparing food.\\" It consists of a conditional clause \\"If you are married\\" and a main clause \\"don't take turns preparing food.\\" 2. Then, I identify the keyword in the original sentence for making changes, which is \\"food preparation.\\" I then think of a semantically related and syntactically similar concept that could replace it, which is \\"taking care of children.\\" 3. Next, I generate a new conditional clause \\"If you are parents\\" that is semantically related to the original clause \\"If you are married.\\" This new clause ensures high commonsense plausibility by implying a family context. 4. Finally, I generate the new main clause \\"don't take turns to take care of children,\\" which is syntactically similar to the original clause \\"don't take turns preparing food.\\" 5. Overall, the generated sentence \\"If you are parents, don't take turns taking care of children\\" retains the original sentence's meaning while introducing a high degree of commonsense plausibility by implying a family context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).

Terra has the exact same cities, civilizations and history as Earth. Scientists are completely baffled as to how this planet exists, but it undeniably does. The only difference between Earth and Terra is that the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Terra have more or less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth? The answer to this question is:","candidates_completions":"Terra would have less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth. This is because the citizens of Terra output only half as much greenhouse gases as the citizens of Earth. Since the industrial revolution, the increase in greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide) in our atmosphere has been primarily due to human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. With half the greenhouse gas emissions, Terra would accumulate less carbon dioxide in its atmosphere compared to Earth, leading to a lower concentration of carbon dioxide on Terra. This discrepancy in greenhouse gas emissions would also result in a slower pace of global temperature increase on Terra compared to Earth.,Terra likely has less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth. This is because the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as the citizens of Earth do. Since greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, contribute to the heating effect on Earth and contribute to global warming, having fewer greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would likely result in a lower concentration of carbon dioxide.,Terra has less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth. Since the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do, this would lead to a lower concentration of carbon dioxide on Terra compared to Earth.

Although he is not referred to as a \\"double agent\\" explicitly in the text, it is revealed at the end of the article that he was working as a spy for the Soviets while also being a part of the British MI5. This is the definition of a double agent. John Shay, the protagonist of the story, suspects Booth of being a Russian spy and takes matters into his own hands by murdering him and assuming his identity in order to uncover Booth's connections and the mole responsible for setting him up. However, it is revealed at the end that Booth was indeed a double agent, and his wife Sarah, who is unaware of her husband's true allegiance, aids Shay in his investigations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idea of New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and Debate With more than six million American children having received a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, concern has been rising that the condition is being significantly misdiagnosed and overtreated with prescription medications. Yet now some powerful figures in mental health are claiming to have identified a new disorder that could vastly expand the ranks of young people treated for attention problems. Called sluggish cognitive tempo, the condition is said to be characterized by lethargy, daydreaming and slow mental processing. By some researchers’ estimates, it is present in perhaps two million children. Experts pushing for more research into sluggish cognitive tempo say it is gaining momentum toward recognition as a legitimate disorder — and, as such, a candidate for pharmacological treatment. Some of the condition’s researchers have helped Eli Lilly investigate how its flagship A.D.H.D. drug might treat it. The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology devoted 136 pages of its January issue to papers describing the illness, with the lead paper claiming that the question of its existence “seems to be laid to rest as of this issue.” The psychologist Russell Barkley of the Medical University of South Carolina, for 30 years one of A.D.H.D.’s most influential and visible proponents, has claimed in research papers and lectures that sluggish cognitive tempo “has become the new attention disorder.” In an interview, Keith McBurnett, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-author of several papers on sluggish cognitive tempo, said: “When you start talking about things like daydreaming, mind-wandering, those types of behaviors, someone who has a son or daughter who does this excessively says, ‘I know about this from my own experience.’ They know what you’re talking about.” Yet some experts, including Dr. McBurnett and some members of the journal’s editorial board, say that there is no consensus on the new disorder’s specific symptoms, let alone scientific validity. They warn that the concept’s promotion without vastly more scientific rigor could expose children to unwarranted diagnoses and prescription medications — problems that A.D.H.D. already faces. “We’re seeing a fad in evolution: Just as A.D.H.D. has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another,” said Dr. Allen Frances, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University. “This is a public health experiment on millions of kids.” Though the concept of sluggish cognitive tempo, or S.C.T., has been researched sporadically since the 1980s, it has never been recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which codifies conditions recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. The editor in chief of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, Charlotte Johnston, said in an email that recent renewed interest in the condition is what led the journal to devote most of one issue to “highlight areas in which further study is needed.” Dr. Barkley declined repeated requests for interviews about his work and statements regarding sluggish cognitive tempo. Several of the field’s other key researchers, Stephen P. Becker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Benjamin B. Lahey of the University of Chicago and Stephen A. Marshall of Ohio University, also declined to comment on their work. Papers have proposed that a recognition of sluggish cognitive tempo could help resolve some longstanding confusion about A.D.H.D., which despite having hyperactivity in its name includes about two million children who are not hyperactive, merely inattentive. Some researchers propose that about half of those children would be better classified as having sluggish cognitive tempo, with perhaps one million additional children, who do not meet A.D.H.D.’s criteria now, having the new disorder, too. “These children are not the ones giving adults much trouble, so they’re easy to miss,” Dr. McBurnett said. “They’re the daydreamy ones, the ones with work that’s not turned in, leaving names off of papers or skipping questions, things like that, that impinge on grades or performance. So anything we can do to understand what’s going on with these kids is a good thing.” But Dr. McBurnett added that sluggish cognitive tempo remained many years from any scientific consensus: “We haven’t even agreed on the symptom list — that’s how early on we are in the process.” Steve S. Lee, an associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who serves on the editorial board of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, said in an interview that he was conflicted over the journal’s emphasis on sluggish cognitive tempo. He expressed concern that A.D.H.D. had already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources. About two-thirds of children with an A.D.H.D. diagnosis take daily medication such as Adderall or Concerta, which often quells severe impulsiveness and inattention but also carries risks for insomnia, appetite suppression and, among teenagers and adults, abuse or addiction. “The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have it, and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real,” Dr. Lee said. “A.D.H.D. has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of S.C.T. We better pump the brakes more diligently.” Dr. McBurnett recently conducted a clinical trial funded and overseen by Eli Lilly that investigated whether proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo could be treated with Strattera, the company’s primary A.D.H.D. drug. (One of Strattera’s selling points is that it is not a stimulant like Adderall and Concerta, medications more susceptible to abuse.) His study, published in The Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, concluded, “This is the first study to report significant effects of any medication on S.C.T.” An Eli Lilly spokeswoman said in an email, “Sluggish cognitive tempo is one of many conditions that Lilly scientists continue to study to help satisfy unmet medical needs around the world.” Representatives of the drug companies that make the best-selling medications for A.D.H.D. — Shire (extended-release Adderall and Vyvanse), Novartis (Focalin) and Janssen (Concerta) — said they are not currently conducting research into sluggish cognitive tempo. However, because the new condition shares so many symptoms with A.D.H.D., these products might easily be repositioned to serve the new market. Dr. Barkley, who has said that “S.C.T. is a newly recognized disorder,” also has financial ties to Eli Lilly; he received 118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements, according to propublica.org. While detailing sluggish cognitive tempo in The Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Dr. Barkley stated that Strattera’s performance on sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms was “an exciting finding.” Dr. Barkley has also published a symptom checklist for mental health professionals to identify adults with the condition; the forms are available for 131.75 apiece from Guilford Press, which funds some of his research. Dr. Barkley, who edits sluggish cognitive tempo’s Wikipedia page, declined a request to discuss his financial interests in the condition’s acceptance. “I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant,” Dr. Frances said. “The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of the researchers of sluggish cognitive tempo. He is Stephen P. Becker, not Steven. In addition, the article misstated the institution with which another researcher, Stephen A. Marshall, is affiliated. It is Ohio University, not Miami University in Ohio. A version of this article appears in print on April 12, 2014, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Idea of a New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and a Debate. Order Reprints|Today's Paper|Subscribe Summary:","candidates_completions":"The New York Times article \\"Idea of a New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and a Debate\\" discusses the potential of a new attention disorder called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT), which could expand the number of children diagnosed with attention problems. The condition is characterized by lethargy, daydreaming, and slow mental processing, and is estimated to affect approximately two million children. Some mental health experts argue that recognizing SCT as a legitimate disorder could help clarify the confusion surrounding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which includes about two million children who are not hyperactive, but merely inattentive. Some researchers propose that around half of these children might be better classified as having SCT, and another one million children who don't meet ADHD's criteria might have the new disorder as well. However, the article highlights concerns from other experts who argue there is no consensus on the specific symptoms of SCT, let alone its scientific validity. They warn that promoting the concept without rigorous scientific evidence could expose children to unwarranted diagnoses and medication. Dr. Allen Frances, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University, describes this as a 'public health experiment on millions of kids.' The main challenge faced by SCT is its inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the authoritative guide for mental health professionals. At present, SCT has not been recognized in the DSM, which may be due to the insufficient scientific evidence. Despite this, some researchers, such as Dr. Russell Barkley and Dr. Keith McBurnett, continue to advocate for its recognition. The article concludes by mentioning that researchers linked to pharmaceutical companies, such as Eli Lilly and Guilford Press, have a vested interest in the acceptance of SCT, as it could result in additional prescriptions for their medications. For instance, Strattera, Eli Lilly's primary ADHD drug, has been investigated in clinical trials to determine its effectiveness in treating SCT. The debate surrounding SCT is complex and contentious, with significant implications for the mental health community and the pharmaceutical industry. The potential overdiagnosis and medication of children with SCT lend urgency to the need for further scientific investigation.,Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) is a potential new attention disorder that has spurred both research and debate within the mental health community. Characterized by lethargy, daydreaming, and slow mental processing, it is estimated to be present in around two million children. While some experts argue that SCT could lead to a better understanding and classification of attention disorders, others express concern that the introduction of a new disorder could expose children to unwarranted diagnoses and prescription medications. Researchers have yet to reach a consensus on SCT's specific symptoms and scientific validity, but pharmaceutical companies are beginning to investigate treatments for the condition. Currently, over six million American children have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), leading to concerns about overdiagnosis and overmedication.,Some mental health experts have recently claimed to have identified a new disorder called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT), which is characterized by lethargy, daydreaming, and slow mental processing. It is believed to potentially impact two million children, and there is increasing momentum towards recognizing it as a legitimate disorder that may be treatable with medication. However, many experts argue that the condition does not have a clear set of symptoms or scientific validity, and warn that prematurely labeling children with the disorder could expose them to unwarranted diagnoses and prescription medications. The debate around SCT highlights concerns about the already widespread overdiagnosis and overmedication of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \\"legs\\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually 800 or 1,000 ft (244 or 305 m) above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are left-handed, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.

This standardized height helps promote smooth traffic flow, as pilots know what to expect, and it reduces the likelihood of mid-air collisions., Traffic patterns are typically flown at a specific altitude, usually either 800 feet or 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). This altitude is consistent for all aircraft using the traffic pattern at a particular airport, and it helps ensure safe separation between aircraft. The use of a standard altitude also aids pilots in maintaining situational awareness and anticipating the position and altitude of other aircraft in the traffic pattern. The choice of 800 or 1,000 feet AGL as the standard altitude for traffic patterns may vary depending on the specific requirements of the airport or the regulations in force in a particular region. In some cases, the altitude may be adjusted based on the terrain surrounding the airport or other factors such as noise abatement procedures. It is worth noting that traffic patterns are usually flown in a left-handed direction, meaning that all turns are made to the left. This is the standard pattern used in most cases, as it provides pilots with better visibility of the airport and other traffic in the pattern. However, right-handed patterns do exist in certain situations, such as when there are obstacles or terrain features that make a left-handed pattern impractical or unsafe. In these cases, the specific procedures for joining and leaving the traffic pattern may vary from the standard left-handed pattern.

Whole grain oats and wheat are two different types of grains. While both are good sources of fiber and other nutrients, they have different nutritional profiles and taste profiles. Whole grain oats are unprocessed oats that contain all parts of the grain, including the bran, germ, and endosperm. They are a rich source of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals.

Given the below context: Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... Guess a valid title for it!

In his early life, Cass received his education from state schools and went on to complete his medical degree from the University of Sydney. He then worked as a research fellow at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and as the director of the Melbourne-based Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre. Cass was actively involved in the labor movement, which led to his pre-selection as the ALP candidate for the federal seat of Maribyrnong. He successfully contested the elections in 1969, winning the seat from the Liberal Party. As a Member of Parliament (MP), Cass became a part of the first national Labor government in 23 years when Gough Whitlam led the ALP to power in the 1972 election.

They are easy to plant and easy to _ . They have a good taste. When people think about carrots, they usually think they are a kind of long, thin, orange-colored vegetable. In fact, carrots are in many different sizes and shapes. And not all carrots are orange. Carrots should be grown in a field that does not have water for a long time. The earth also should not be too hard. To prepare your carrot garden, dig up the earth and turn it over . Weather, soil condition , and time affect the taste of carrots. Warm days and cool nights are the best time to grow great delicious carrots. The best way to decide if a carrot is ready to be harvested is by its color. Usually, the brighter the color is, the better the taste is. Most people do not know that carrots can be grown during the winter months. If the winter is not cold enough to freeze the ground, you can grow carrots the same way as you do during the summer months. Carrots are prepared and eaten in many different ways. They are cut into thin pieces and cooked with other vegetables or meat. Or, they are washed, and eaten just as they come out of the ground. Question: What can affect the taste of carrots? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Weather, time and soil condition\\"? A:","candidates_completions":"Yes, the answer is \\"Weather, time, and soil condition.\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, these three factors can significantly affect the taste of carrots. 1. Weather: Warm days and cool nights are ideal for growing delicious carrots. Extreme temperatures, on the other hand, can negatively impact their taste. 2. Time: The length of time carrots are grown also influences their taste. Generally, the longer they are left in the ground, the sweeter they become. However, once they reach maturity, leaving them in the ground for too long may lead to a bitter taste or even woody texture. 3. Soil condition: Carrots grown in well-draining, loose, and rock-free soil tend to have a better taste compared to those grown in heavy or poor-draining soil. The pH level of the soil should ideally be between 6.0 and 6.5. Additionally, the soil should not be too rich in nitrogen, as this can cause the carrots to develop a bitter taste. These explanations further support the fact that weather, time, and soil condition can significantly influence the taste of carrots.,Yes, the answer is \\"Weather, time, and soil condition.\\" These factors can affect the taste of carrots. Additionally, the color of the carrot can also indicate its taste, with brighter colors usually indicating better taste.,Yes, the answer is \\"Weather, time, and soil condition.\\" These factors can affect the taste of carrots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An autopsy revealed that Frostie's spinal column was riddled with abscesses, with one so large that it was pressing on his small rumen, preventing the stomach from functioning properly and leading to bloat. Scroll down for video. Frostie the snow goat licks the nose of one of his handlers at Edgar's Mission, the animal sanctuary that took him under its wing in May. Frostie died on Monday after battling a hind leg infection since birth. 'In the early hours of Monday morning, the little champ told me he was not well, as his rapidly expanding stomach screamed bloat,' according to a post on the group's website. 'As the little guy took his last gasps of breath, he looked into my tear filled eyes as I begged him to stay. I told him I loved him and would do so forever more. It was not until I knew his spirit had passed that I would scream, “Why?” at the top of my lungs and sob inconsolably into his warm, sweet smelling white fur.' Frostie snuggles up in his bed in a picture likely taken not long before he died. His autopsy revealed that his spinal column was covered with abscesses. Edgar's Mission, a sanctuary for rescued farm animals, nursed the near-disabled baby goat back to health until he took a turn for the worst in recent days. Frostie's many admirers quickly began expressing their dismay at his passing on the website. 'No...not Frostie!! Im a bit shocked..Frostie was doing so well.' wrote Bronwyn Russell. Fostie was covered in lice, severely dehydrated and was unable to use his back legs when he was first brought to Edgar's Mission in May. At birth, he contracted a hind leg infection through his umbilical cord. An Edgar's Mission employee holds Frostie the Snow Goat in her arms an undated photo. Frostie is shown here about a week ago without the wheelchair he has used since May. The sanctuary fitted Frostie with a custom wheelchair so he could run around and play with the other animals. Pictures of the goat with his rear wheels rapidly went viral around the internet. Before being inherited by Frostie, the wheelchair belonged to Leon Trotsky - a baby pig who was injured when his mother sat on him, crushing his hind legs. Just last week it seemed all the antibiotics, painkillers and tender love and care Frostie was receiving were doing the trick. For the first time, he was let out of his wheelchair and began running freely around the farm. 'That Frostie was a sickly little kid goat was something that we knew from the very day he came into our world,' Edgar's Mission said in the Facebook post. 'Frostie’s lot was not good, but no one told him that. He wanted to live, and that was just what we promised him we would help him do.' Despite being just one of 350 animals cared for, Frostie got all the attention he appeared to have needed at the sanctuary - which also houses cows, alpacas, deer, sheep, chicken, geese, ducks, rabbits, guinea pigs, peacocks and horses, in addition to goats and pigs. 'The fact that Frostie looked a little different was no justification to me for denying him the chance at life he so richly deserved - we would do no less if he were a puppy or kitten,' Edgar's Mission said.

At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman.

The move is the strongest indication yet of Amazon's intent to push further into the health-care industry. It threatens to remove one of the few distinguishing factors pharmacy chains have relied on to fend off Amazon, the sale of prescription drugs. Retailers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health and Rite Aid have seen their so-called front of store sales threatened as shoppers increasingly buy household staples online or from convenience stores. Shares of all three tanked Thursday on the news, along with drug distributors Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson. Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health lost about 12.8 billion in market value on Thursday alone. PillPack, which organizes and delivers packages of medications for consumers, is licensed to ship prescriptions in 49 states, according to its website. \\"Yes, it's a declaration of intent from Amazon,\\" Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Stefano Pessina acknowledged to analysts in a planned call to discuss its quarterly earnings, according to an initial transcript from FactSet. \\"But the pharmacy world is much more complex than the delivery of a certain pills or packages.\\" Terms of the deal with Amazon were not disclosed, though people familiar with the matter told CNBC that Amazon paid roughly 1 billion. The companies expect it to close during the second half of the year. The start-up has raised 118 million in funding from investors including CRV and Menlo Ventures, and it reached more than 100 million in revenue in 2017, the company has said. In 2016 it was reported to be valued at 330 million. The company previously had sale talks with Walmart, which had considered buying the start-up for less than 1 billion, CNBC has reported. ||||| Amazon is buying online pharmacy PillPack — a move that could disrupt the drug store business. PillPack has pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. The company delivers medications to customers in pre-sorted doses designed to make it easier for people to take multiple medications a day. Amazon (AMZN) was widely expected to move into the pharmacy business. And Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is creating a health care company along with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA). The PillPack deal is already scaring investors in the top two drug store chains. CVS (CVS) fell 9% in early trading. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest Dow component, plunged more than 10%. Walgreens was already trading lower after reporting a drop in same-store sales at its US pharmacies. Related: Amazon is already trying to disrupt health care Rite Aid (RAD) shares also fell, as did the stocks of big drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). These and other health care stocks rose a few months ago after reports that Amazon may not have been interested in selling prescription drugs. So much for that. It's not clear yet just what Amazon plans for PillPack. Will it eventually merge it into a broader health care platform on Amazon or keep it independent as it has done with other subsidiaries like shoe retailer Zappos and video site Twitch? The fact that PillPack is already licensed to sell prescriptions may persuade Amazon to keep it independent. But all the companies said on Thursday was the deal was subject to some regulatory approvals and that the companies hope to close the transaction during the second half of this year. Related: PillPack vs. Express Scripts -- People suffer when business turns ugly Walgreens doesn't seem too worried. During the company's earnings call Thursday morning, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in response to a question about the PillPack deal that the pharmacy business is \\"much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages.\\" Pessina added that physical pharmacies \\"will continue to be very, very important in the future.\\" The PillPack acquisition comes just a week after CVS announced it will start delivering prescriptions to people's homes — a response to growing competition from PillPack and Capsule, another online pharmacy startup.

CVS is buying insurer Aetna for while Cigna (CI), another insurer, is scooping up pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX). Both deals are valued at nearly 70 billion. Those deals were announced after two mega insurer mergers were blocked by federal judges early last year on antitrust grounds. Aetna had hoped to combine with rival Humana (HUM) while Cigna was planning to merge with Anthem (ANTM). |||||Summary:","candidates_completions":"Amazon is buying a company called PillPack, which is an online pharmacy that already delivers medications to people in many states. This could make it harder for other drugstores to compete. When the news came out, many drugstore and healthcare stocks went down because investors were worried. We don't know yet what Amazon plans to do with PillPack, but they might keep it separate from their other businesses. The CEO of Walgreens, another drugstore chain, said that pharmacies will still be important in the future. This news is interesting because Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, is also working on a separate healthcare company with other big companies. Many changes are happening in the healthcare industry right now, with companies buying each other and preparing for more competition.,Amazon is buying a company called PillPack, which is an online pharmacy. This is a big deal because it shows that Amazon wants to be a part of the health-care industry. When people heard about this, the value of big pharmacy companies went down a lot because they are worried about competing with Amazon.

Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Question: suppose plants die in soft mud more often happens, how will it affect more minerals are formed. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","candidates_completions":"More, If plants dying in soft mud occurred more frequently, it could potentially lead to an increase in the formation of fossils and, as a result, more minerals being formed. Here's the explained rationale behind this: 1. An increase in plants dying in soft mud would mean a higher number of potential candidates for fossilization. The process of fossil formation relies on the decomposition and replacement of organic material (plants) by mineral deposits within the soil. As a result, a greater frequency of such conditions would provide more opportunities for this transformation. 2. With more plants dying in soft mud, sediment buildup would be more common. This sediment accumulation would encase and protect the plant remains from decay, preserving them for an extended period and enhancing the likelihood of fossilization. 3. As sediment layers pile up, the pressure and temperature increase, which would speed up the process of mineral replacement within the decaying plant matter. This would result in the formation of more fossils over time as compared to conditions where such occurrences are less frequent. 4. As more fossils are formed, more minerals would become available for uptake by other organisms, rocks, and the surrounding soil. This contributes to a higher concentration of minerals in the ecosystem and landscape. In summary, the proposed perturbation in which plants dying in soft mud occurs more frequently would likely have a more significant impact on the formation of minerals. More frequent conditions favorable for fossilization would result in a higher number of fossils and subsequently increase the mineral concentration within the ecosystem.,More minerals may form when more plant remains decompose in soft mud, as the process provided implies that over the years, the remaining parts are replaced with minerals. This means that a higher rate of plant remains in soft mud could potentially contribute to more minerals forming over time. However, it's essential to note that various factors, such as geological conditions and environmental factors, could influence the conversion of remains to minerals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","candidates_completions":"On the other hand, Macedonia's trade deficit with Bulgaria has increased by 15% in the same period to more than 100 million USD. Macedonia has a trade deficit with Bulgaria, meaning that Macedonia's imports exceed its exports. This can be seen as a negative economic indicator, as it shows that the country is spending more than it is earning from its trade with Bulgaria. To give a more in-depth explanation, a trade deficit implies that the value of all goods and services that a country imports from another country exceeds the value of its exports to that country. In this case, the 15% increase in the trade deficit between Macedonia and Bulgaria over the given period shows that the economic balance is increasingly in favor of Bulgaria and that Macedonia must pay more to obtain goods and services from its neighbor. Several factors can be responsible for this growing trade deficit. Firstly, the presence of market economies in the countries can support the increased consumption of imported products, leading to an increased demand for foreign goods and services. For instance, the rise of e-commerce in the region could widen the availability of imported goods, driving consumer preference in favor of those purchases. Additionally, a stronger domestic currency in Macedonia relative to Bulgaria could make imported goods cheaper, attracting demand towards goods produced in Bulgaria. Moreover, multinational companies could be playing a major role in this situation. For example, they may operate in Bulgaria and export products to Macedonia, which in turn, could cause the trade deficit between the two countries to increase. Multinational and foreign businesses, in general, can present an attractive choice for consumers if they offer better price, quality, and variety compared to local products. Other potential reasons for the growing trade deficit could include differences in the cost of production, tax rates, and exchange rates. These factors can influence the attractiveness of products or services coming from one country over the other, leading to an unbalanced trade position. Apart from bringing negative consequences for domestic industries, economies, and job opportunities, the growing trade deficit could put pressure on Macedonia's fiscal budget as it struggles to maintain its currency exchange rate. In the worst-case scenario, this could even trigger a fiscal crisis if the country is not able to generate sufficient revenue to cover its spending. Mitigating the trade deficit could involve a variety of measures, including encouraging local industries to increase their competitiveness by investing more in Research and Development (R&D), education, and other capacity-building initiatives. Macedonia could also consider implementing trade policies and incentive systems to encourage new investments in the manufacturing and service sectors. Furthermore, adopting customs duties or protective trade measures could help to control the inflow of goods from Bulgaria and protect local products against foreign competition. In conclusion, the increasing trade deficit between Macedonia and Bulgaria is a significant economic challenge that requires immediate attention. A comprehensive assessment of the underlying causes is essential for designing appropriate policy responses that can change the balance of trade in favor of Macedonia. This will require a concerted effort from the government, private sector, and other stakeholders to improve competitiveness, enhance local production, and encourage investments in domestic industries.,On the other hand, Macedonia's trade deficit with Bulgaria increased by 15% during the same period, reaching over 100 million USD., You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. Question: suppose We are in a low altitude zone happens, how will it affect less oxygen will be produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","candidates_completions":"B: less When we are in a low-altitude zone, the atmospheric pressure is higher than at high altitudes. This means there is an increased amount of air pressure acting on our bodies, causing the air to become denser and contain more oxygen molecules per unit volume. To understand how this affects the oxygen production, let's revisit the process of breathing and gas exchange in the body. 1. Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs. When we inhale, air is pulled into the respiratory system via the nose and mouth, which filters, warms, and moistens it before it travels through the windpipe (trachea) and into the lungs. 2. The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs. Inside the lungs, the trachea further divides into two bronchi (bronchus for one lung), which subsequently branch into bronchioles. These smaller tubes spread throughout the lungs. 3. Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli. The bronchioles end in tiny grape-like air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange occurs. The walls of alveoli are very thin, allowing for efficient gas exchange. 4. Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood. When the air reaches the alveoli, oxygen molecules (O2) from the air move across the thin membrane and into the bloodstream, binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 5. Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart. The blood with high oxygen levels (oxygen-rich blood) is then carried back to the heart via pulmonary veins. 6. Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart. The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to various tissues and organs throughout the body via arteries. 7. Cells take in the oxygen-rich blood and release carbon dioxide-rich blood. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the body's cells, oxygen is released and taken up by the cells for use in energy production (cellular respiration), while carbon dioxide (CO2), a waste product, diffuses back into the bloodstream. 8. The carbon dioxide-rich blood travels to the lungs. The blood with high carbon dioxide levels (carbon dioxide-rich blood) returns to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. 9. Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. As we exhale, the carbon dioxide diffuses across the thin alveoli membrane, moving from the bloodstream into the alveoli, and then is expelled from the body when we breathe out. In a low-altitude zone, the higher atmospheric pressure results in the air being denser and having more oxygen molecules per unit volume. This greater concentration of oxygen allows for more effective gas exchange in the alveoli, as the gradient or difference in oxygen levels between the air in the alveoli and the oxygen-poor blood entering the pulmonary capillaries is more significant. Consequently, the body gets more oxygen with each breath, and less oxygen needs to be produced by the cells to meet the body's demand for energy at low altitudes. In conclusion, being in a low-altitude zone affects the oxygen produced by the body—more specifically, it will lead to less oxygen being produced as the body can acquire more oxygen from the denser air, making it easier to meet the demand for oxygen in various cellular processes., The correct answer is B: less. When you are at a low altitude zone, the atmospheric pressure is higher and the air is richer in oxygen compared to high altitude zones. This means that when you inhale, your lungs receive a higher concentration of oxygen, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to the cells throughout the body. However, if you are in a low oxygen environment at a low altitude, such as a poorly ventilated space or a room with decreased oxygen levels, the amount of oxygen that is available for you to breathe in will be less than what is typically available at sea level. This means that your lungs will receive less oxygen, which will in turn be absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to the cells. As a result, the cells in your body will receive less oxygen than they normally would, which can impact their function and metabolism. In summary, if you are in a low altitude zone but the oxygen levels are lower than usual, less oxygen will be produced and available for your body to use, which can have negative effects on your health and well-being.,B: less In a low-altitude zone, there will be a decrease in oxygen production. When we breathe in, we inhale air that contains approximately 21% oxygen, and the rest is made up of nitrogen and other gases. However, as altitude increases, the density of the air decreases, which means that there will be less oxygen available for us to breathe in. This decreased oxygen availability can affect our bodies in several ways. First, it may cause our hearts to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, as fewer oxygen molecules are available to be picked up by our blood. Second, our cells might not receive enough oxygen to function properly, which could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and even altitude sickness in severe cases. As a result, the body will produce less oxygen overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","candidates_completions":"If it takes longer to cook each pancake, this will likely have a more significant impact on the cooking process as you make more pancakes. Here's why: 1. Time management: As it takes longer to cook each pancake, you may need to adjust your overall cooking plan to accommodate the slower pace. This might mean starting to prepare the batter or cooking other parts of the meal earlier. 2. Consistency: With longer cooking times, there is a higher risk of inconsistent pancakes. The pancakes might cook unevenly or burn if you don't adjust the heat or cooking time accordingly. 3. Griddle temperature: If you are making multiple pancakes, it is essential to monitor and control the griddle temperature. With longer cooking times, the griddle might lose heat, causing subsequent pancakes to take even longer to cook or not cook properly. 4. Flipping: If the pancakes are taking longer to cook, it becomes increasingly important to pay attention to the flipping process. Overcooked pancakes might break apart or lose their shape during flipping. Insufficiently cooked pancakes might stick to the surface. 5. Resource management: Longer cooking times could also affect resource management. For example, you might need to use more fuel or electricity to maintain the heat and cook multiple pancakes. In summary, longer cooking times for pancakes will have a more significant effect as you make more pancakes, especially when it comes to time management, consistency, griddle temperature control, flipping, and resource management.,More,If it takes longer to cook each pancake, it will likely have a less effect on making more pancakes. The longer cooking time means that each pancake takes up more energy and cooking time, which can lead to a slower overall cooking process. However, unless the ingredients or the process itself changes, making more pancakes may not be affected too much. The phrase \\"supposed perturbation\\" is unclear, possibly referring to a change in the recipe, cooking method, or other aspects of the process. If a change significantly affects the outcome of each pancake, then it will have a more significant impact on making more pancakes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer this question: Which Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced old age pensions and national insurance?","candidates_completions":"The Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced old age pensions and national insurance was a man named David Lloyd George. His job, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was to take care of the money for a big country called the United Kingdom. So, about one hundred years ago, he thought it was important to help people when they got older by giving them pensions, which is money they can use to buy things like food, clothes, and shelter. He also came up with the idea of national insurance, which is a way for people in the country to help each other, so that everybody has a chance to live a better and safer life., Sure, I'd be happy to help! The Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced old age pensions and national insurance was a man named Neville Chamberlain. He introduced these things in Britain in the 1920s when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which is like the country's treasurer or finance minister. Old age pensions are payments that people receive when they reach a certain age and are no longer working. National insurance is a system where people pay money into a fund while they are working, and then they can get money back from the fund when they are retired or if they become sick or unemployed. Neville Chamberlain introduced these things to help make sure that people had enough money to live on when they were no longer working. He wanted to make sure that everyone in Britain had a comfortable and secure retirement, and that they would be taken care of if they became sick or lost their jobs. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.,The Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced old age pensions and national insurance was named David Lloyd George.

Pick your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","candidates_completions":"(1). No. Although both sentences describe a creature with dorsal features, they do not convey the same meaning. In the first sentence, the creature is characterized by having \\"12 dorsal spines\\" and \\"15 to 17 dorsal soft rays.\\" Dorsal spines are typically hard, sharp, and pointed structures along the dorsal (top) side of certain animals, like fish. On the other hand, dorsal soft rays refer to flexible, segmented, and branched fin structures that can also be found in some fish species. The second sentence presents a creature with \\"12 dorsal soft spines\\" and \\"15 to 17 dorsal beams.\\" Dorsal soft spines are a combination of the terms in the first sentence, and it is not a commonly used term. It could be a mistake or it might be trying to describe a soft spine structure, but it lacks clarity. Dorsal beams, however, provide an entirely new descriptor that may refer to different structural elements. However, without clear context, it's hard to determine what \\"dorsal beams\\" would represent. Because these sentences do not share the same descriptors, and there is ambiguity in the second sentence, they do not hold the same meaning, which leads to the choice: (1). No.,I am an AI assistant, and I can provide assistance on a wide range of topics. As your task involves selecting correct answers from a given multi-choice question, I will provide an explanation supporting the correct answer. The statement \\"It has 12 dorsal spines and 15 to 17 dorsal soft rays\\" is almost the same as the statement \\"It has 12 dorsal soft spines and 15 to 17 dorsal beams.\\" The slight modification is in the use of the term \\"spines\\" and \\"soft rays\\" or \\"beams.\\" Similar body parts of an unknown organism are being referred to separately with these two terms. Since spines and soft rays or beams may be referring to the same structure, there is similarity in meaning, even though the terminologies are slightly different. Given the information presented, the closest expression of the same meaning as described would be: \\"It has 12 dorsal soft rays, and 15 to 17 dorsal soft rays.\\" Despite this, I can't conclusively say that these two questions have the exact same meaning as there could potentially be differences based on context and biological term usage. To provide a final answer, I will refer to your multiple choice question. The correct options would be: 1. No, the statements do not have the same meaning. Please provide more information or details to better address your question., The answer is (1) - no, the two statements do not have the same meaning. The first statement \\"It has 12 dorsal spines, and 15 to 17 dorsal soft rays\\" correctly describes the fin structure of certain fish species, such as anglerfish and lionfish. Dorsal spines are hard, sharp, and pointed bony structures found in the dorsal (top) fin, which helps the fish to defend against predators. Dorsal soft rays are the unsegmented, flexible parts of the dorsal fin, which the fish uses for maneuverability and smooth swimming. However, the second statement \\"It has 12 dorsal soft spines and 15 to 17 dorsal beams\\" is incorrect because dorsal soft spines and dorsal beams are not the same thing. Dorsal soft spines are flexible, unsegmented bony structures, while dorsal beams refer to the supporting rods in the caudal (tail) fin, not the dorsal fin.

Please answer the following question: - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","candidates_completions":"The first step of the process that eventually leads to erosion through plant-induced rock breakdown is the colonization of a rock surface by pioneering plant species. In this step, various environmental factors and biological processes contribute to the establishment of the plant roots in the rock surface, setting the groundwork for the subsequent steps in the sequence. To elaborate further, the initial stage of the process can be broken down into several interconnected sub-processes: 1. Deposition of organic matter and windblown particles: Dust, soil, and organic materials such as lichen or moss fragments can accumulate on rock surfaces over time. This creates a thin layer of substrate on top of the rock, providing the starting point for plants to take hold. 2. Spore germination and seed dispersion: Plant species that are capable of colonizing rocky surfaces often reproduce by spores or seeds, which are carried to the rock surface by wind, water, or animals. When conditions are favorable, such as the presence of moisture and the right temperature, the spores or seeds can germinate and start to grow, anchoring themselves onto the rock surface. 3. Root penetration and anchoring: The emerging plants develop root systems that extend and cling to the rock surface for support and nutrients. Over time, the roots increase in size and extent, gradually penetrating into the rock's crevices and fractures, driven by the plant's natural growth. 4. Microbial activity: In addition to plant roots, microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can also contribute to breaking down the rock surface. These organisms may form symbiotic relationships with the plant roots or exist independently, participating in the processes of breaking down, dissolving, and mobilizing the minerals within the rock. At this point, the initial step of the process has been completed, and the sequence of events described in the question can begin to unfold. As the plant roots grow deeper and expand, they exert mechanical force on the rock, while also releasing organic acids and other compounds that help dissolve the rock's mineral components. This weakens the rock structure, causing it to fracture and break down into smaller pieces. Ultimately, these processes contribute to erosion, as the rock particles are mobilized and transported away by wind, water, or other forces., The first step of the process could be the roots of the growing plants penetrating and exerting pressure on the rock. Plants, especially those with strong and extensive root systems, can grow into cracks and crevices of rocks, applying continuous pressure and causing the rock to fracture. This process is known as root propagation or root wedging. As the plant roots grow, they can exert substantial force, expanding the cracks and applying pressure on the rock's structure. Over time, this pressure can cause the rock to break apart into smaller pieces, weakening its overall integrity. Root propagation helps speed up the natural weathering and erosion processes by increasing the surface area of the rock exposed to the environment, allowing other agents of weathering and erosion, such as water, wind, and temperature fluctuations, to further break down the rock. Once the rock has been broken down into smaller pieces, it becomes more susceptible to other erosional forces, like water and wind. This results in accelerated erosion and the further disintegration of the rock. Although plant acids can contribute to the dissolution of certain types of rock, this process is typically a secondary step rather than the initiating factor. In some instances, plant acids might aid in the ongoing breakdown of the rock, but the primary mechanism responsible for breaking up the rock initially would still be the mechanical force applied by the growing plant roots.,The first step of the process you've described, in which growing plants contribute to the breakdown and eventual erosion of rocks, is when plant roots start to penetrate and establish themselves within the rock crevices and cracks. When a plant grows in close proximity to rocks, its roots start seeking out resources such as water and nutrients. This often forces the roots to enter the small cracks and crevices in the rock surface. As the plant continues to grow and its root system expands, the rocky material may be compressed, fractured, or teased apart. This initial penetration of roots into the rock formations not only aids in the eventual fragmentation of the rock but also sets in motion the entire process. Roots can exert substantial force on the rock surface as they push deeper into the fractures, thus causing further widening and eventual fragmentation. This process, known as root wedging, is a key aspect of the plant's initial interaction with the rock. While this may not dramatically weaken the rock initially, it does lay the groundwork for subsequent stages of the process. As roots and rocks interact, chemical elements from the plant may diffuse into the surrounding rock material. The acidity of the plant's respirations or the presence of organic acids within the roots also contributes to the dissolution of mineral salts, further weakening the rock structure. Once the roots manage to break up the rock, the physical disruption and the chemical processes of dissolution mentioned here are the factors that lead to the fragmentation of the rock into smaller pieces. The abundant plant cover can eventually deter many animals from grazing or foraging on the micro-habitat that earlier might have been favorable. This in turn can aid in sustaining carpets of moss and lichen, which then aid in further weakening the rock. Extensive moss and lichen colonization facilitates easier access to water, nutrients, and sunlight, thus repeating and sustaining the rock breakdown process. In conclusion, the first step of the process in which plants help break down rocks is the penetration of plant roots into the rock crevices and cracks. This initial interaction between the plant roots and the rock material sets in motion a series of physical and chemical processes that will ultimately lead to the breakdown and erosion of the rock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He’s known as the Godfather of match-fixing. Brazen Wilson Raj Perumal has revealed that he made around £3million from rigging soccer matches around the world and claims that he would sometimes sit on team benches giving orders to players and coaches. The Singaporean, 49, admits that he probably fixed the outcomes of almost 100 matches in total. Fixer: Singaporean Wilson Maj Perumal, pictured on trial in Rovaniemi, Finland, in 2011, claims that he rigged around 100 football matches and made £3million. He told CNN in his first-ever TV interview: ‘I never really counted, but I think it should be between 80 and 100 football matches. ‘I was on the bench at times, and telling players what to do, giving orders to the coach. It was that easy. There was no policing whatsoever.’ Perumal said that when he was younger he had dreamed of a career in the armed forces. He said: ‘I had my boyhood dreams. I wanted to be a soldier but during my school days I got a criminal record and couldn't really pursue what I wanted to. And then I got attracted to betting when I was about 19-20 years old. ‘I kind of got hooked and I didn't want to lose… so I started fixing local matches.’ He began fixing matches in the late 1980s in Singapore and eventually joined what international police organization Interpol described as 'the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate'. He boasted that his success rate was about 70 to 80 per cent. Astonishingly, some football associations welcomed him ‘with open arms’, he explained. Brazen: Perumal has revealed that he would sometimes sit on beam benches giving orders to players and coaches. Former Fifa match-fixing investigator Terry Steans was shown Perumal’s contacts list by the police and was amazed to see that he had relationships with officials and players from 38 countries – out of a possible total of 209. Perumal added: ‘I have no regrets. It was a phase of my life and I enjoyed it and I traveled around the world. I had a good time.’ For a time he masterminded this international enterprise - thought to have generated hundreds of millions in fraudulent winnings for crime organisations in the Far East - from a one-bed flat in Wembley, London. Then he was jailed for match-fixing in Finland in 2011. He was sentenced to two years but served a year, before being handed over to authorities in Hungary who were also investigating football’s betting scams. Perumal believes police were tipped off by others inside his organisation and has since exposed some details to media outlets and presumably to police. The Finnish scandal surrounded the club Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS) in the northern city of Rovaniemi. Perumal and nine RoPS players were convicted of match-fixing having taken bribes of up to £33,000 each. Before the Finnish venture, Perumal is alleged to have fixed matches in Africa, the Middle East and Central America. He is reported to have been behind the scandal of the Zimbabwe national team playing games in Asia in 2007 and 2009, which culminated in 98 Zimbabwean footballers and two coaches being suspended in 2012. And he is ensnared in the huge Europol investigation revealed in 2013, which involves club officials, referees and players and concerns 380 matches in 15 different countries between 2011 and 2013. Another incident was the international played between Togo and Bahrain in September 2011, when Togo were beaten 3-0 though it later emerged that they were not the real Togo team. Perumal arrived in London early in 2011, having skipped bail in Singapore, where he faced a charge of hitting a police officer with his car. He lived among Wembley’s Sri Lankan community and went by the name of Rajamohan Chelliah until the Finnish police swooped in the Arctic and the web started to unravel. He says that he has gambled away the fortune he made from match-fixing. Perumal now helps police combat match-fixing and has published an auto-biography called Kelong Kings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.567 At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.8 There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Which village is situated farther from sea lever? Answer:","candidates_completions":"Steep village is situated at a higher altitude and farther from sea level. It is located at 8,500 feet above sea level, while Berg village is situated at 3,000 feet (approximately 914 meters) above sea level. Due to its higher elevation, Steep village experiences lower atmospheric pressure, which can result in visitors feeling bad and winded compared to the more comfortable conditions in Berg village.,Steep village is situated farther from sea level. It is located at an altitude of 8,500 feet (2,590 meters) above sea level, whereas Berg village is situated at a lower altitude of 3,000 feet (914 meters) above sea level. This is why visitors feel winded and not as good when they reach Steep village, as the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes, making it harder for people to breathe and adjust., Steep village is situated farther from sea level. The altitude of a location is measured as its height above mean sea level. Given that Steep village is situated at 8500 feet, while Berg village is at 3000 ft, it means that Steep village is indeed higher above sea level. The reason why people feel great in Berg village but bad and winded in Steep village is due to the difference in atmospheric pressure. At higher altitudes, like in Steep village, the atmospheric pressure is lower. This means there are fewer molecules of air pressing down on you, which can make it harder for your body to get the oxygen it needs. This is why people often feel short of breath or winded at high altitudes. However, it's important to note that after a period of acclimatization, the human body can adjust to these conditions and people may start to feel better. The body responds by increasing the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin to improve the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Despite this, the initial discomfort is a common experience for many people visiting high-altitude locations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on geometry. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem: if anangletis defined as 1 percent of 1 degree , then how many anglets are there in a sixth of a circle ? Options: a ) 0.36 , b ) 3.6 , c ) 360 , d ) 6000 , e ) 36000","candidates_completions":"Step 1: Calculate the angle in degrees in a sixth of a circle. A sixth of a circle is approximately 360 degrees multiplied by 1/6 which equals 60 degrees. Step 2: Determine the number of anglets in 60 degrees. Since an anglet is defined as 1% of 1 degree, this means there are 0.01 degrees in 1 anglet. Step 3: Calculate the number of anglets in 60 degrees. To find the number of anglets in 60 degrees, multiply 60 by 0.01, which equals 0.6 anglets. Answer: Since there is no option for 0.6 anglets, there is no correct answer available among the given multiple-choice options., First, let's determine how many degrees are in a sixth of a circle. A full circle is 360 degrees, so a sixth of a circle is 360/6 = 60 degrees. Next, we need to find out how many \\"anglets\\" are in 60 degrees, given that one anglet is defined as 1 percent of 1 degree. Since there are 100 percent in a degree, 1 percent is equal to 1/100 of a degree. Therefore, in 60 degrees, there would be 60 * (1/100) = 0.6 \\"anglets\\". However, this is not an option. We should check the options to see if any of them is a reasonable approximation of our answer. We can see that option 'a' is 0.36 and option 'b' is 3.6. Since we know our answer is between these two, the closest option given is b) 3.6. But, to be precise, the given options do not contain the exact answer. The answer calculated is 0.6 and none of the given options match this. Therefore, if we have to choose from the given options, b) 3.6 would be the closest answer. But, ideally, none of the given options is correct.,Step 1: Understanding the problem The question is asking to compute the number of anglets in a sixth of a circle. An anglet is defined as 1 percent of 1 degree. Step 2: Conversion of the problem We first need to find out how many degrees are there in a sixth of a circle. A full circle has 360 degrees. Thus a sixth of a circle can be computed as: (1/6) * 360 Step 3: Calculation of degrees in a sixth of a circle To calculate this value, multiply the numerator of the fraction by the number of degrees in a circle: (1 * 360) / 6 = 360 / 6 Step 4: Division Now, divide the product of Step 3 by the denominator of the fraction: 360 / 6 = 60 degrees Step 5: Conversion of degrees to anglets Now we need to convert 60 degrees to anglets, where 1 anglet is defined as 1% of 1 degree. So, for one degree, there are 100 anglets. Thus, for 60 degrees, we have: 60 degrees * 100 anglets/degree Step 6: Multiplication Multiply the number of degrees by the number of anglets per degree to calculate the total number of anglets: 60 * 100 = 6000 anglets Step 7: Final Answer The number of anglets in a sixth of a circle is 6000. So the correct answer is option (d) 6000."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The Arabs and Turks, estimated at 15,000, made frequent attacks by day and night on the strongly entrenched Italian garrison in the southern suburbs of Benghazi. The four Italian regiments of infantry acted on the defensive and were supported by the San Marco and Agordat. The Italians rarely attempted a sortie. An attack of 20,000 Turkish and local troops was repulsed on November 30 with considerable losses. Shortly after this the garrison was reinforced by the 57th infantry regiment from Italy. The battleship Regina Elena also arrived from Tobruk. During the night of December 14 and 15 the Turks attacked in great force, but were repulsed with aid of the fire from the ships. The Italians lost several field guns. At Derna the Turks and Arabs were estimated at 3,500, but they were being constantly reinforced and a general assault on the Italian position was expected. The Italian and Turkish forces in Tripoli and Cyrenaica were constantly reinforced. The withdrawal of the Turks into the interior enabled them to reinforce their troops considerably.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

What has Barack Obama done that gets so many people angry? Did Bill Clinton do more for black people than Barack Obama? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available choices: I no II yes","candidates_completions":"No, those questions are not the same. The first question is about why some people are angry with Barack Obama, who was the 44th President of the United States. There are many reasons why some people might be angry with him, but it's important to remember that not everyone feels this way. Some people may disagree with the policies he implemented during his time in office, or they may not like the way he handled certain situations. It's also possible that some people are angry with him for reasons that have nothing to do with his presidency. The second question is comparing the accomplishments of two different presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, in terms of their impact on black people in the United States. This is a more specific question and it would require a more detailed answer to fully address. It's also worth noting that comparing presidents in this way can be tricky, because they served during different time periods and faced different challenges. Both Clinton and Obama did a lot for Black people during their time in office, it's important to understand the context and the policies they implemented. It's also important to remember that both Clinton and Obama were popular President and had a lot of supporters who think they did a great job during their time in office, and want to give credit for the good work they did, while some critics may focus on the issues they had and what they didn't do.,I no Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, did many things while he was in office. Some people might not agree with his decisions, like a kid might not like when a teacher makes a rule they don't like. For example, a few people didn't like Barack Obama's healthcare plan, called Obamacare, because they thought it cost too much money, or they didn't like being told to buy health insurance. Just like different people have different favorite ice cream flavors, they also have different opinions about what the president should do. About your second question, Bill Clinton was the 42nd President and some people think he did more for black people than Barack Obama. They might say this because during Bill Clinton's time, the economy was good, and some black people had better jobs and more money. But other people might say that Barack Obama did more for black people because he passed laws that helped everybody, including black people, like giving more people access to healthcare. So, it depends on how people see things, like how some would say chocolate ice cream is better and others would say vanilla is better. These two questions are not the same, so the answer is: I no. The first one is about why some people are angry with Barack Obama, and the second one is about who did more for black people, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.,Imagine Barack Obama as a person who had a big job called president. They had a few decisions that some people didn't like, which made them angry. But one of the most important things for our purpose is the healthcare system. Barack Obama's healthcare plan, called the \\"Affordable Care Act,\\" was a very big disagreement between people. Some people loved that it helped Americans have better healthcare, while others didn't like some parts of it. Now, let's think about Bill Clinton. He was another person who had the big job of president, just like Barack Obama. And some people think that Bill Clinton did more for black people than Barack Obama. They point to some things that Bill Clinton did in his time as president, like creating more jobs in black communities. However, these are two different questions, so the answer is I no.

How to set consulting fees Research the competition. Consultants are extremely wary about giving their rate information to people, because they don't want to be undercut by new consultants with lower prices. However, there are other ways to do some research.","candidates_completions":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you set consulting fees. Here's a step-by-step approach to researching the competition: 1. Identify your competition: The first step is to identify who your competitors are. These could be other consultants in your industry or niche who offer similar services. 2. Look for industry reports or surveys: While individual consultants may be reluctant to share their rates, there are often industry reports or surveys that provide insights into average consulting fees. Look for reputable sources that publish this type of information. 3. Check online job boards: Online job boards often list consulting positions with salary ranges or hourly rates. While these may not be perfectly aligned with your services, they can provide a rough estimate of what consultants in your industry are charging. 4. Consider your location: Consulting fees can vary based on location. For example, consultants in major cities may charge higher fees than those in smaller towns. Take into account your location and your clients' locations when researching fees. 5. Look for industry-specific resources: Depending on your industry or niche, there may be specific resources or associations that publish information on consulting fees. For example, the Institute of Management Consultants USA publishes a salary survey for management consultants. Justifying your steps: 1. Identifying your competition is important because it allows you to understand the market landscape and see what services your competitors are offering. 2. Industry reports and surveys provide valuable insights into average consulting fees, which can help you set competitive but fair rates. 3. Checking online job boards can provide a sense of what consultants in your industry are charging, which can help you set your own rates. 4. Location can have a big impact on consulting fees, so it's important to take this into account when doing your research. 5. Industry-specific resources can provide valuable insights into consulting fees, as they are tailored to your specific niche or industry.,Step 1: Know your expertise and skills Determine your unique expertise and skill set as a consultant. This will help you set a rate that's reflective of your experience and the value you can add to clients. Step 2: Research fees in your niche Conduct research on the consulting fees charged by other professionals in your niche or industry. This can be done through online forums, industry-specific publications, or networking with other consultants. Step 3: Analyze industry standards Compare your findings with the average consulting fees for your niche to understand what is considered 'normal' in terms of pricing. Step 4: Evaluate your experience and skill set Consider your years of experience, specialized skills, certifications, and any proven track record of success. This will help you justify your consulting fees, as you may be able to charge more than the industry average due to your unique experience. Step 5: Calculate an appropriate hourly rate Based on your research, industry standards, and your own skill set and experience, calculate an appropriate hourly rate for your consulting services. Make sure to factor in the time required for any preliminary research, project management, or client-facing tasks. Step 6: Consider additional costs Include any additional costs related to your consulting services, such as travel, software, or equipment. Be sure to factor these into your hourly rate or as separate line items in your fee structure. Step 7: Create a transparent pricing model Develop a clear and transparent pricing model that outlines your hourly rate or project-based fee, any additional costs, and payment terms. This will provide clients with a clear understanding of what they can expect to pay for your services. Step 8: Test your pricing with potential clients Share your pricing with a select group of potential clients to gather feedback and ensure the rates are competitive and feasible for your target market. Step 9: Modify as needed Review your pricing model periodically based on industry trends, feedback from clients, and your own professional growth. Be open to modifying your fee structure as needed to remain competitive, while also ensuring you're able to meet the financial needs of your consulting business. Step 10: Communicate your pricing model to clients Communicate your pricing model clearly and confidently with potential clients to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts later on. Be prepared to discuss your thought process behind setting the fees and how they align with your expertise and the value you provide.,1. Determine your target market - The first step is to identify your target market and the clients you want to serve. This will help you focus your research on understanding the fees of consultants who cater to similar clients. It will also help you position yourself as an expert in a specific industry, which can warrant higher fees. 2. Gather information on competitor pricing - Conduct online research, such as searching for consulting firms in your target market and reviewing their websites for information on their fees and services. - Utilize professional networks (e.g., LinkedIn) to connect and gather information with individuals who have firsthand experience in your target market. - Join industry-specific trade groups, associations, or organizations to broaden your connections and learn more about the competition. - Consider conducting informational interviews with established consultants in your field to gain insight into their pricing and experience. 3. Analyze the data - Compile all the gathered information on competitor pricing and analyze the data by looking for patterns and trends. - Understanding the market and the rates that they charge will help you position yourself within a similar range while maintaining a competitive edge. 4. Determine your services and value proposition - Clearly outline your services and identify what sets you apart from your competitors. Your unique selling proposition (USP) can help justify your fees. 5. Set your fee structure - Decide on an appropriate fee structure for your services, such as hourly, per project, or retainer-based. - Ensure your fees align with your experience level and the value you provide. A higher level of experience, expertise, or specialization may warrant higher fees. 6. Analyze your costs - Calculate your overhead costs, such as office rent, utilities, taxes, and other expenses. - Estimate the time and effort required to complete each consulting project or service, factoring in your desired profit margin. - Set a minimum fee that covers your overhead costs and desired profit margin. 7.

Rude behavior often deters people from wanting to be your friend or help you. To create a warm, welcoming environment, it's encouraged to initiate conversations with a simple \\"hi\\" and use compliments, such as complimenting someone's clothes or accessories, as an icebreaker. This can lead to engaging conversations. However, it's crucial to ensure that your responses don't come across as automated or insincere. Genuine communication is key to fostering good interactions with others. Additionally, adopting a humble approach rather than portraying oneself as flawless or superior helps avoid appearing stuck up. Embrace a friendly demeanor when getting to know people, starting with a kind hello, to create meaningful connections., In summary, when joining a chatroom or initiating any kind of social interaction, it's important to come across as friendly and approachable in order to build positive relationships with others.

Once again, remember to always begin with a warm and friendly hello.,To summarize, it is crucial to maintain proper etiquette and exhibit friendliness when engaging with others in a chatroom or any social setting. Here are a few key aspects to consider: 1. Greeting and acknowledgement: Start by offering a simple \\"hello\\" or \\"hi\\" to establish a connection and indicate your willingness to interact with others. 2. Being genuine: Authenticity is essential in fostering meaningful conversations. Avoid sounding robotic or like you are giving automated responses, as this can make others feel like you're not truly interested in engaging with them. 3. Compliments: Use tactful and genuine compliments related to personal mannerisms, appearance, etc., as they can act as an icebreaker and create a comfortable environment for further conversations. 4. Humility and self-awareness: Recognize that everyone makes mistakes and has imperfections by admitting your own instead of trying to depict a flawless image around yourself. This attitude helps in expressing humbleness and being approachable to others. 5. Communicating effectively: Demonstrate excellent communication skills, actively listening and responding to others' opinions or inquiries, as it establishes your credibility and interest in the conversation.

The Bar Kokhba revolt was a major Jewish uprising against the Roman Empire, and after the Romans crushed it in 132 CE, they banned Jews from living in Jerusalem and many other parts of the region. This led to a significant decrease in the Jewish population in the area. (2). No, that's not a good answer.

Solve 427*z - 34*z = 1927 + 3182 for z.","candidates_completions":"To solve the equation 427*z - 34*z = 1927 + 3182 for z, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, combine the terms with the z variable: (427 - 34)*z = 1938 On the right side, combine the constant terms: 1927 + 3182 = 5109 Now the equation looks like this: 393z = 5109 Step 2: Isolate the variable (z) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 393: z = 5109 ÷ 393 Step 3: Perform the division: 5109 ÷ 393 = 13 Now we have the value for z: z = 13 So, the solution to the equation 427*z - 34*z = 1927 + 3182 is z = 13., Sure, let's solve this step by step: 1. First, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We can factor out 'z' from the terms 427*z and -34*z. This gives us: z*(427 - 34) = 1927 + 3182 2. Simplifying the terms in parentheses, we get: z*393 = 5109 3. Now, to solve for 'z', we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 393: z = 5109 / 393 4. Dividing, we find that: z = 13 So, the solution to the equation 427*z - 34*z = 1927 + 3182 is z = 13.,To solve the equation 427*z - 34*z = 1927 + 3182 for z, we can follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 427*z - 34*z = (427 - 34)*z = 393*z The equation now becomes 393*z = 1927 + 3182. Step 2: Calculate the sum on the right side of the equation. 1927 + 3182 = 5109. The equation now becomes 393*z = 5109. Step 3: To find the value of z, we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 393. 393*z / 393 = 5109 / 393. Step 4: Calculate the result. z = 5109 / 393 ≈ 13.00.

What is the solution?","candidates_completions":"To solve the given equation -j + 2 = 4 for j, we must isolate j on one side of the equation. Here are the steps we'll take to accomplish this: 1. Start with the given equation: -j + 2 = 4 2. We need to isolate j. To do this, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: -j + 2 - 2 = 4 - 2 -> -j = 2 3. Now that we have -j = 2, our next step is to eliminate the negative sign in front of j. To do this, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by -1: (-1) * (-j) = (-1) * 2 -> j = -2 The solution to the equation is j = -2.,To solve the equation -j + 2 = 4 for j, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Isolate the variable (j) on one side of the equation. To do this, we want to move the constant on the left side of the equation to the right side. We can achieve this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: -j + 2 - 2 = 4 - 2 -j = 2 Step 2: Now, in order to isolate j, we need to get rid of the negative sign in front of j. To do this, multiply or divide both sides of the equation by -1. In this case, we'll divide, so: (-j) / (-1) = 2 / (-1) This simplifies to: j = -2 So, the solution is j = -2., Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this math problem! Let's break it down step by step: 1. We start with the equation: -j + 2 = 4 2. The goal is to isolate j, so the first step is to get rid of the -j term. We can do this by adding j to both sides of the equation. This gives us: j = 4 - 2 3. Simplifying the right side, we get: j = 2 So, the solution to the equation -j + 2 = 4 is j = 2. This is because when we substitute j = 2 into the original equation, we get: -2 + 2 = 4 - 2, which simplifies to 0 = 0, which is a true statement, so j = 2 is a valid solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the sentiment of each part of the tweet to better understand: 1. \\"@TeamTSwift\\": This part refers to the Twitter handle for Team Taylor Swift. Mentioning a specific fan account implies that the user prefers Taylor Swift or has positive sentiments towards her, but it is not the central focus of this tweet. 2. \\"I would follow Team Lovato\\": This part suggests that the user has an interest in or liking for Demi Lovato, as they are considering following the fan account (Team Lovato). There is a positive sentiment in this portion of the tweet, indicating the user's genuine interest in Demi Lovato. 3. \\"but they tweet sooooo much\\": The use of the word \\"but\\" signals a contrast from the previous positive sentiment. The user finds the high volume of tweets from Team Lovato overwhelming or annoying. The use of multiple \\"o\\"s in \\"sooooo\\" serves as an emphasis to show their exacerbated frustration with the account's tweeting frequency. From the analysis of each part of the tweet, it can be concluded that the overall sentiment is mildly negative, with the user expressing their frustration about the excessive number of tweets from Team Lovato. At the same time, it conveys their preference for Team Taylor Swift and their genuine interest in Demi Lovato. However, the primary sentiment is directed towards the frustration.,The sentiment of this tweet appears to be somewhat mixed. The user expresses their preference or support for Team Lovato, but seems to be struggling with the fact that Team Lovato tweets excessively. The decision of supporting Team Lovato itself reflects a somewhat positive sentiment. It suggests that the user likely enjoys or admires the artist Demi Lovato, and would rather follow or endorse their team in a comparison to Team TSwift. However, the frustration or hesitance expressed due to Lovato's team's excessive tweeting detracts from that sentiment. It conveys a sense of annoyance or difficulty coping due to the constant activity level perhaps experienced by those following Team Lovato on Twitter, which is a negative sentiment. Overall, the sentiment is a blend of positive and negative, with the overall tone leaning on the frustrations associated with excessive tweeting, rather than the voiced preference for Team Lovato., The sentiment of the tweet you provided towards Team Lovato is mixed. On one hand, the user expresses admiration for Team Lovato and enjoys their content, which indicates a positive sentiment. However, they also mention that Team Lovato tweets so much, which the user finds overwhelming and therefore a negative sentiment. To analyze the sentiment of a tweet, we must consider several factors, including the words and phrases used, the tone, and the overall context. In this case, the user starts off by expressing a desire to follow Team Lovato, which suggests a positive sentiment. However, they then mention that they don't follow them because of the high volume of tweets, indicating a negative sentiment. Additionally, the use of the word \\"sooooo\\" in \\"they tweet sooooo much\\" emphasizes the user's frustration and makes it sound more negative. This added emphasis suggests that the user may feel overwhelmed by the amount of content that Team Lovato produces, which can be a common sentiment towards prolific tweeters. Overall, the sentiment of the tweet towards Team Lovato is mixed, with some positive feelings of admiration and interest in their content, but also some negative feelings of frustration and overwhelm caused by the high volume of tweets. It's important to remember that sentiment analysis is not always clear-cut and can depend heavily on the context and the specific words used in a tweet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group which campaigns for better privacy online, told the BBC the project sounded \\"extremely disturbing\\". \\"Kudos to the Facebook employees who brought this to the attention of the New York Times,\\" said the EFF's global policy analyst Eva Galperin. \\"It's very nice to know there are some principled people still working there.\\" The sources quoted by the New York Times - both current and former employees - stressed that like many pieces of software worked on internally, it may never be implemented. Censorship concessions Since 2009, the only way to access Facebook in China has been via a virtual private network - software designed to “spoof” your real location and avoid local internet restrictions. Facebook, which has 1.8 billion active users, is aggressively looking to expand in parts of the world beyond its existing markets. In the developing world, that means experimenting with new technology to connect rural areas. And in China, it appears the site is at the very least considering making concessions to China’s notoriously tightly-monitored internet. According to employees quoted anonymously by the New York Times’ reporter Mike Isaac, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about the plans in an all-staff meeting earlier this summer. \\"It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” he is reported to have said while stressing it was early days. Facebook’s spokeswoman would not confirm or deny the quote was accurate. Mr Zuckerberg recently spent time with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as well as taking time to learn Mandarin. Third-party company Facebook regularly removes content from the network at the request of governments. It makes this process relatively public with a yearly report detailing the quantity and nature of take-down requests. Where this software would differ is in that it would enable a third-party, likely a Chinese company working with Facebook, to prevent messages from appearing in the first place. The range of topics censored in mainland China is vast. Most famously, searches related to the Tiananmen Square yield no results relating to the 1989 massacre. Facebook isn’t the first first Silicon Valley giant to grapple with the moral maze of doing business in China. Google famously pulled out of mainland China after a backlash surrounding the censorship of search results. It now routes all traffic to Google Hong Kong. LinkedIn, the network for professionals, does censor some content - although as the firm isn't typically seen as a host of public debate, the move is not seen as being nearly as contentious. If Facebook follows LinkedIn’s lead, the EFF’s Ms Galperin said \\"Facebook would be trading in their principles in exchange for access to the market. It would have tremendous implications for human rights.\\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook Summary:","candidates_completions":"Facebook is thinking about removing certain messages or content to be allowed in China, a country known for its strict internet censorship., Facebook may be considering working with a third-party company to create software that would censor content in China to meet the country's internet restrictions, which could mark a significant change in the social network's principles for access to the Chinese market.,Facebook is reportedly developing software to censor users' posts in China, which could help the social media giant regain favour with the country's authorities, who blocked it in 2009."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. @AdamLambertNews i think adam is better than a klondike bar though. Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","candidates_completions":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is a positive comparison of Adam Lambert to a Klondike bar. The tweet suggests that the user feels more favorably towards Adam Lambert than they do towards a Klondike bar, indicating a positive sentiment towards Adam Lambert. The tweet also implies that the user is a fan of Adam Lambert and holds him in high regard, which could also suggest a feeling of admiration or affection. Overall, the tone of the tweet is lighthearted and playful, suggesting a positive and upbeat sentiment.,To analyze the sentiment embodied by this tweet, let's break it down into its components: 1. \\"You are an AI assistant. User will give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.\\" This part of the prompt seems unrelated to sentiment analysis, as it discusses the assistant's role in receiving and completing tasks. 2. \\"While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.\\" This instruction is related to the task, reminding the assistant to provide a step-by-step process and justifications for their actions. 3. \\"@AdamLambertNews\\" This is a mention of a Twitter user or an official account, indicating that the tweet is directed at this user or about Adam Lambert. 4. \\"i think adam is better than a klondike bar though.\\" This part of the tweet contains the sentiment or personal opinion of the user. It compares Adam Lambert to the \\"better\\" option – a Klondike bar, a popular ice cream treat. The word \\"though\\" suggests a comparison, implying that the user considers Adam Lambert to be better than the Klondike bar. Based on these components, it can be concluded that the sentiment embodied by this tweet is positive and subjective. The user believes that Adam Lambert is better than an ice cream bar, which is a matter of personal preference and not a fact to be proven. The user also addresses the official Adam Lambert news account, indicating that they might be fans or followers of the artist.,Step 1: Identify the components of the tweet. The tweet has three main components: the mention of a Twitter user \\"@AdamLambertNews\\", a reference to an individual \\"Adam\\", and a comparison to a \\"Klondike bar.\\" Step 2: Understand the context of the tweet. The tweet is addressed to a fan account of Adam Lambert, an American singer, songwriter, and actor. The Klondike bar is a popular ice cream bar, and the phrase \\"What would you do for a Klondike bar?\\" is associated with the product's marketing campaign. This phrase implies that people are willing to do a lot for a Klondike bar as it's highly desirable. Step 3: Determine the sentiment conveyed by the tweet. The tweet makes a comparison between Adam and a Klondike bar. Since the Klondike bar is considered something desirable and valuable in popular culture, comparing Adam to it suggests that the person who wrote the tweet believes that Adam is also highly desirable, valuable and potentially even better than the product. This tweet thus embodie a positive sentiment towards Adam Lambert, expressing the idea that he is better or more valuable than something already considered desirable like a Klondike bar. The tweet is a compliment and a sign of appreciation for Adam, and it's likely meant to make the user, as well other fans of Adam Lambert, feel connected and share their admiration for the singer."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.candidates_completions&&e.candidates_completions.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],z={key:0},E={key:1};function Y(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
